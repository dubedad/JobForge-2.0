<current_state>
Exploring swarm intelligence concepts for GSD. Built and tested a proof-of-concept that demonstrates stigmergy-based task execution (workers self-select tasks, signals strengthen with use).

**NOT a GSD phase** - this is experimental R&D for a potential GSD feature proposal.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Concept Development
- Defined 5 swarm rules (strengthen what works, weaken what fails, leave trail, follow strong trail, accept decay)
- Documented behavioral DNA for swarm workers in `proposals/swarm-protocol.md`
- Created RFC for GSD repo in `proposals/gsd-swarm-rfc.md`
- Wrote explanations for Liam in `proposals/swarm-summary-for-liam.md` and `proposals/swarm-examples-for-liam.md`

## PoC Infrastructure
- Created `proposals/swarm-test/poc/run_test.py` - setup/status/cleanup script
- Created `proposals/swarm-test/poc/WORKER_PROMPT.md` - protocol for Claude to follow
- Created `proposals/swarm-test/poc/TEST_PLAN.md` - testing methodology
- Created `proposals/swarm-test/poc/control_chart.py` - SPC monitoring (over-engineered, may simplify)

## Test Executions
- Ran swarm protocol twice, both successful
- 6/6 tasks completed each time
- 19/19 tests passing
- Signals updated correctly (pattern strength increased with use)
- All artifacts isolated in `.swarm-poc/`, `src/poc/`, `tests/poc/`

## Latest Discussions
1. **North Star Task Codes** - tasks carry codes linking to strategic purpose, agents get "supercharged" on contact
2. **A/B Testing for Emergence** - tasks receive "current optimal play" with variance for innovation
3. **Control Charts** - use SPC (5/7 point runs) to detect pattern improvement/degradation
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Simplify control chart to just timing + basic flagging
2. Create minimal `swarm:execute` skill parallel to `gsd:execute`
3. Run timed A/B comparison: swarm vs GSD on equivalent tasks

## Future Considerations
- Add north-star codes to task schema
- Implement 90/10 exploit/explore split
- Test with multiple concurrent workers (true swarm behavior)
- Propose to GSD repo if validated
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Isolated PoC | Test without modifying GSD or project files |
| Signal files (JSON) | Simple, human-readable, easy to update |
| Trails as JSONL | Append-only, timestamped activity log |
| Manual protocol first | Validate concept before building skills |
| Tasks in pending/claimed/complete dirs | File system as state machine |
| North star as pointer not value | Avoid staleness when strategy changes |
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. PoC is working. User wants to simplify before continuing.
</blockers>

<context>
User is exploring how to make GSD agents behave like a swarm with emergent intelligence. Key insight: instead of orchestrator assigning tasks (foreman model), workers self-select based on signals (swarm model).

The control chart stuff got over-engineered. User wants minimal testable scope:
- `swarm:execute` skill they can invoke
- Simple timing log
- Manual A/B comparison against `/gsd:execute-phase`

Created `.swarm-poc/SWARM_EXECUTE.md` as manual protocol and `.swarm-poc/timing.md` for logging.

Mood: Exploratory, iterative. User learning through experimentation.

<next_action>
Start with: Run a timed test comparing swarm vs GSD execution, or simplify the control chart to just track times.

To reset PoC: `python proposals/swarm-test/poc/run_test.py cleanup && python proposals/swarm-test/poc/run_test.py setup`

To clean up entirely: `python proposals/swarm-test/poc/run_test.py cleanup` then delete `proposals/` if desired.
