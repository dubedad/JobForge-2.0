# Requirements: JobForge 2.0

**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Auditable provenance from source to output — every artifact traces back to authoritative sources, including DADM directive chapter and verse.

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for self-imputing model and live demo. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Imputation & Data Quality

- [x] **IMP-01**: Validate and port imputation system from prototype
- [x] **IMP-02**: Hierarchical attribute inheritance (L5->L6->L7 filtered context)
- [x] **IMP-03**: O*NET API integration for SOC-aligned attribute candidates
- [x] **IMP-04**: LLM-powered attribute imputation for empty cells
- [x] **IMP-05**: Description generation (job titles, families, functions)
- [x] **IMP-06**: Multiple description sources with provenance (authoritative vs LLM-generated)

### New Data Sources

- [x] **SRC-01**: Scrape TBS Occupational Groups page with full provenance
- [x] **SRC-02**: Follow embedded links for occupational group metadata
- [x] **SRC-03**: Extend DIM Occupations schema with scraped fields

### Demo & MCP

- [x] **MCP-01**: Port MCP configuration from prototype to JobForge 2.0
- [x] **MCP-02**: `/stagegold` live demo via MCP (Power BI + UI split screen)
- [x] **MCP-03**: Basic UI for demo narration (what JobForge is doing)

### Governance & Compliance

- [x] **GOV-02**: DADM traceability log — demonstrates observable compliance with Directive requirements
- [x] **GOV-03**: DAMA traceability log — demonstrates observable compliance with DAMA DMBOK
- [x] **GOV-04**: Job classification log — demonstrates observable compliance with Classification Policy, Process and Practice
- [x] **GOV-05**: Conversational interface for data queries
- [x] **GOV-06**: Conversational interface for metadata queries
