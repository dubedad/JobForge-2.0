**Core Value:** Auditable provenance from source to output

## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for Data Layer Expansion milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### TBS Occupational Groups

- [ ] **OG-05**: Scrape rates of pay (represented/unrepresented)
- [ ] **OG-06**: Create `dim_occupational_group` gold table
- [ ] **OG-07**: Create `dim_occupational_subgroup` gold table
- [ ] **OG-08**: Create `dim_og_qualification_standard` gold table
- [ ] **OG-09**: Create `dim_og_job_evaluation_standard` gold table
- [ ] **OG-10**: Create `bridge_noc_og` concordance (group/subgroup level, not classification levels)

### CAF Careers

### Data Governance

- [ ] **GOV-09**: DMBOK practice provenance for all new tables
- [ ] **GOV-10**: Update data catalogue with new table metadata

## v3.1+ Requirements (Deferred)

If Phase 16 moves to v3.1:
- OG-03, OG-04, OG-05, OG-08, OG-09: Extended OG metadata
- CAF-06: Training requirements fact table

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Classification levels (e.g., NU-HOS-01) | Too granular; group/subgroup sufficient for concordance |
| Real-time forces.ca sync | Static scrape sufficient; manual refresh as needed |
| Pay rate calculations | Raw data only; calculations are consumer app responsibility |
| French language scraping | English primary; bilingual deferred to v3.1+ |

## Traceability
