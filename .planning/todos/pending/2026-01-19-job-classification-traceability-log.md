title: Job classification log for Classification Policy compliance
area: governance

---

## Problem

Users need to demonstrate observable compliance with Classification Policy, Process and Practice for job/position classification. Currently there's no way to pull a traceability log that shows how job classification decisions in WiQ align with official classification policies.

This is critical for HR/workforce planning use cases where classification decisions must be auditable and defensible against policy requirements.

## Solution

TBD - Likely involves:
- Tracking classification decisions with rationale/citations
- Linking NOC codes to classification policy requirements
- Generating audit trail for classification assignments
- May integrate with Job Architecture data from Phase 2
