title: DADM traceability log for Directive compliance
area: governance

## Problem

Users need to demonstrate observable compliance with the DADM (Directive on Automated Decision-Making) requirements. Currently there's no way to pull a traceability log that shows how WiQ's data pipeline and outputs align with Directive Requirements for automated decision systems.

This is a government compliance requirement - the ability to show auditors/oversight that the system meets DADM obligations.

## Solution

TBD - Likely involves:
- Mapping WiQ artifacts to DADM requirements
- Generating a compliance report/log that traces data provenance to directive clauses
- May integrate with lineage system from Phase 5
