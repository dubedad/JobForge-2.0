title: DAMA traceability log for DMBOK compliance
area: governance
files: []

## Problem

Users need to demonstrate observable compliance with DAMA DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge) standards. Currently there's no way to pull a traceability log that shows how WiQ's data management practices align with DAMA DMBOK framework areas (data governance, data quality, metadata management, etc.).

This enables organizations to show their data management maturity against an industry-standard framework.

## Solution

TBD - Likely involves:
- Mapping WiQ catalog/lineage artifacts to DAMA DMBOK knowledge areas
- Generating a compliance matrix showing coverage of DMBOK practices
- May leverage existing catalog structure (already using DAMA DMBOK directory layout)
