<current_state>
v3.0 Data Layer Expansion completed and archived. v4.0 Governed Data Foundation ready to begin. Phase 17 (Governance Compliance Framework) is planned with 5 plans in ROADMAP.md, but execution hasn't started.

Clean milestone boundary - ideal pause point.

<remaining_work>
**v4.0 Governed Data Foundation (7 phases, 40 requirements):**
- Phase 17: Governance Compliance Framework (5 plans) - NEXT
- Phase 18: Data Quality Dashboard (TBD plans)
- Phase 19: Business Metadata Capture (TBD plans)
- Phase 20: O*NET Integration (TBD plans)
- Phase 21: Job Architecture Enrichment (TBD plans)
- Phase 22: PAA/DRF Data Layer (TBD plans)
- Phase 23: GC HR Data Model Alignment (TBD plans)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- v3.0 archived with full milestone completion workflow
- Added missing v2.1 entry to MILESTONES.md
- Updated gitignore for experimental directories (proposals/, poc/, lineage/)
- Catalog enrichments committed as separate chore commit
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Clean state ready for v4.0.
</blockers>

<context>
Project is at natural milestone boundary. v3.0 shipped TBS OG and CAF data layer. v4.0 focuses on:
- Governance compliance (DAMA DMBOK audit, policy provenance)
- Data quality (GC DQMF 9-dimension scoring)
- 5-taxonomy completion (O*NET as 5th taxonomy)
- HR Data Model alignment

Key v4.0 research findings already captured in STATE.md:
- cuallee for Polars-native quality validation
- ckanapi for Open Government Portal
- Streamlit for dashboards
- ~45MB new dependency footprint
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:progress` to see current state, then `/gsd:plan-phase 17` to begin v4.0 execution.

## ARCHIVED: JD Builder Design Notes (from 2026-01-21)

The JD Builder design discussion was captured but v3.0 pivoted to Data Layer Expansion instead. These notes are preserved for future reference:

- JD Builder involves BUILD phase (authoritative universe) + CLASSIFY phase (factor-based classification)
- Three-level matching: L7 (example titles) → L6 (labels) → L5 (NOC unit groups)
- Dual-direction corroboration for confidence scoring
- JD Factors still need definition

See PROJECT.md Future Requirements for JDB-01 through JDB-05.
