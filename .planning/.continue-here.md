<remaining_work>

**No active work.** Options:

1. **Plan v3.0 milestone** - `/gsd:new-milestone`
   - Candidate: RAG/vector search (RAG-01, RAG-02, RAG-03)
   - Candidate: Job Description Builder UI (JDB-01 through JDB-05)

2. **Quick tasks** - `/gsd:quick`
   - Ad-hoc improvements without full milestone planning

3. **Demo the system** - `jobforge api` then http://localhost:8000/
   - Landing page with query UI is live
   - 12 example queries across 4 business domains
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Quick task 001:**
- FileResponse over StaticFiles mount (avoids route conflicts)
- Automatic fallback from data to metadata queries (JS handles 4xx)
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no build step, immediate deployment)
- Example queries organized by business use case, not technical layer
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.
</blockers>

<context>
User wanted to see a business-friendly interface, not Swagger docs. Built a landing page that:
- Explains what JobForge is
- Shows example questions by use case (Forecasting, Skills, Compliance, Lineage)
- Provides a text box to ask questions
- Displays results with SQL, explanation, and data table
- Links to /docs for developers

The landing page is served at http://localhost:8000/ (root). Swagger moved to /docs.

<next_action>
When resuming:
1. Check if user wants to try the landing page demo
2. If ready for v3.0, run `/gsd:new-milestone`
3. For quick improvements, run `/gsd:quick`

To start API: `jobforge api`
Landing page: http://localhost:8000/
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
