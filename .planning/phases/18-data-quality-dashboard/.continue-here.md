<current_state>
Phase 18 planning is COMPLETE. All 6 plans created and verified.
Ready for execution - no code written yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- /gsd:discuss-phase 18 - Gathered user decisions in 18-CONTEXT.md
- /gsd:plan-phase 18 - Research completed, 6 plans created, verification passed

**Plans created:**
| Wave | Plan | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 18-01 | TDD | Quality models and weights (DQDimension, QualityScore) |
| 1 | 18-02 | TDD | Core metrics (completeness, timeliness, coherence, accuracy) |
| 2 | 18-03 | execute | Quality service and history (snapshots, degradation detection) |
| 2 | 18-04 | execute | API and CLI (endpoints, jobforge quality commands) |
| 3 | 18-05 | execute | Dashboard foundation (Streamlit app, summary page) |
| 3 | 18-06 | execute | Dashboard pages and export (detail, compare, trends, PDF/CSV) |

**Artifacts produced this session:**
- .planning/phases/18-data-quality-dashboard/18-RESEARCH.md (39KB, comprehensive)
- .planning/phases/18-data-quality-dashboard/18-01-PLAN.md through 18-06-PLAN.md
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Execute all 6 plans:**
1. 18-01: Quality models (TDD) - creates src/jobforge/quality/models.py, weights.py
2. 18-02: Core metrics (TDD) - creates metrics.py, validators.py
3. 18-03: Service layer - creates service.py, history.py, calculator.py
4. 18-04: API/CLI integration - adds quality routes and CLI subcommand
5. 18-05: Dashboard foundation - adds Streamlit app with summary page
6. 18-06: Dashboard pages - detail, compare, trends pages + export
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**User locked decisions (from 18-CONTEXT.md):**
- Side-by-side radar chart comparison (2-3 tables on same radar)
- Summary grid landing page with traffic-light status
- Traffic lights show color + percentage score (e.g., 78%)
- Desktop-first optimization
- ISO date format (2026-02-05)
- Export: both PDF reports and CSV data dump
- Fixed GC-aligned weights (not user-configurable)
- Degradation detection: both threshold crossing AND trend-based decline
- CLI outputs: Table (rich), JSON (--json), CSV (--csv)

**Research-informed decisions:**
- cuallee for Polars-native quality validation
- Traffic-light thresholds: >=95% green, 85-94% yellow, <85% red
- 90-day snapshot retention with date-partitioned parquet
- Proxy metrics for non-automatable dimensions (Relevance, Interpretability, Reliability, Access)
- st.navigation for multi-page Streamlit app
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - plans verified and ready for execution.

Note: Phase 18 depends on Phase 17 (Governance Compliance Framework) per roadmap.
Phase 17 has 5 plans created but not yet executed. If dependency matters, execute 17 first.

<context>
This session focused on planning Phase 18 (Data Quality Dashboard). The GSD workflow was:
1. Spawned gsd-phase-researcher → produced 18-RESEARCH.md with GC DQMF framework details
2. Spawned gsd-planner → created 6 executable plans in 3 waves
3. Spawned gsd-plan-checker → verified all requirements covered, no issues

The research is comprehensive (~40KB) covering:
- GC DQMF 9 dimensions with official definitions
- cuallee for DataFrame-agnostic quality validation
- Streamlit patterns (st.navigation, session_state)
- Plotly radar charts (go.Scatterpolar)
- 7 common pitfalls with prevention strategies

All 8 requirements (DQ-01 through DQ-08) are covered by the plans.
</context>

<next_action>
Run: /gsd:execute-phase 18

Or if Phase 17 dependency matters, run: /gsd:execute-phase 17 first

The executor will process plans in wave order:
- Wave 1: 18-01, 18-02 (parallel TDD)
- Wave 2: 18-03, 18-04 (parallel service/API)
- Wave 3: 18-05, 18-06 (parallel dashboard)
</next_action>
