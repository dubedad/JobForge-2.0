<objective>
Create Pydantic models for GC DQMF 9-dimension quality scoring and configure GC-aligned dimension weights.

Purpose: Establishes the foundational data structures for Phase 18 quality measurement. All subsequent plans depend on these models for type-safe quality score representation.

Output: Quality module with models, weights, and 15+ tests proving correct weighted aggregation.

    GC DQMF 9 Dimensions (from RESEARCH.md):
    - ACCESS: Ease to discover, retrieve, process, use
    - ACCURACY: Degree data describes real-world phenomena
    - COHERENCE: Ease to compare/link data from sources
    - COMPLETENESS: Degree values sufficiently populated
    - CONSISTENCY: Degree internally non-contradictory
    - INTERPRETABILITY: Degree understood in context
    - RELEVANCE: Degree suitable for objective
    - RELIABILITY: Degree variability explained
    - TIMELINESS: Time between period end and availability

    GC-Aligned Weights (from RESEARCH.md recommendations):
    - Completeness: 20%
    - Accuracy: 20%
    - Consistency: 15%
    - Coherence: 15%
    - Timeliness: 10%
    - Reliability: 10%
    - Interpretability: 5%
    - Relevance: 3%
    - Access: 2%

    Traffic-Light Thresholds (for gold tables):
    - Green (A): >=95% (production-ready)
    - Yellow (B): 85-94% (needs attention)
    - Red (C/D/F): <85% (critical)

    Test cases:
    - DQDimension enum has exactly 9 members
    - All weights sum to 1.0 (100%)
    - QualityScore with all 100s -> overall 100.0
    - QualityScore with all 0s -> overall 0.0
    - QualityScore with mixed scores -> weighted average
    - Grade "A" for score >= 95
    - Grade "B" for score 85-94
    - Grade "C" for score 70-84
    - Grade "D" for score 60-69
    - Grade "F" for score < 60
    - DimensionScore validates 0-100 range
    - QualityScore.from_dimension_scores() factory method
  </behavior>
  <implementation>
    RED: Write failing tests for dimension enum, weights, and score calculation
    GREEN: Implement models.py with DQDimension, QualityScore, DimensionScore
    GREEN: Implement weights.py with GC_DIMENSION_WEIGHTS and calculation functions
    REFACTOR: Extract grade thresholds to constants, add docstrings
  </implementation>
