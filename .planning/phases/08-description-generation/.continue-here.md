<current_state>
Just started `/gsd:discuss-phase 8` to gather implementation context before planning. Gray area analysis complete but no questions answered yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Phase validated against ROADMAP.md
- Gray areas identified:
  1. Description structure (what goes into descriptions at each level)
  2. Source cascade (authoritative vs O*NET vs LLM priority)
  3. Provenance display (how users see source info)
  4. LLM generation (prompt design, tone, length)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Complete discussion of selected gray areas
- Create 08-CONTEXT.md with implementation decisions
- Then proceed to `/gsd:plan-phase 8`
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
None yet - discussion was just starting.

<blockers>
None.

<context>
Phase 8 is about generating descriptions for job titles, families, and functions. The key domain insight is that this is "content users READ" so discussion should focus on structure, tone, sources, and provenance display.

Phase 7 delivered the external data integration (O*NET, TBS scraping, LLM imputation service). Phase 8 uses those capabilities to generate human-readable descriptions.

Success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Descriptions for job titles showing lead statement from L6 level
2. Descriptions for job families and functions
3. Provenance indicating source (authoritative vs LLM-generated)
4. Multiple sources with visibility into which is which

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:discuss-phase 8` to complete gray area discussion and create CONTEXT.md.
