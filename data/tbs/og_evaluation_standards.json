It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The job evaluation standard for the FB group is a point-rating  plan that includes an introduction, the definition of the  group, the rating scale and level point boundaries. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators. Application Guidelines The Border Services classification standard must be used in conjunction with the \"Application Guidelines\" document. This reference tool has been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the Border Services classification standard in order to appropriately and consistently evaluate Border Services work. Elements Ten elements are used in this job evaluation plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in FB jobs. Element Weighting The importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements. Each element in the FB standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element.

It is a key component of the  classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context. The positions  allocated to the CT occupational group are divided into three subgroups: Internal  Audit (CT-IAU) Financial  Management (CT-FIN) External  Audit (CT-EAV) This standard replaces the following job evaluation  standards: Management (FI) 2016, and Auditing (AU) 1987, and amends the Administrative Services (AS) 1965. Group definition The Comptrollership group comprises positions that are  primarily engaged in internal audits, financial management and external audits. Inclusions The Comptrollership group includes only  those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one of  the following activities: planning,  developing, conducting or managing internal audit work, in accordance with the  internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to assess the effectiveness  of risk management, control or governance processes; planning,  development, analysis, delivery or management of internal public service  financial policies, programs, services or other related activities; the  application of a comprehensive knowledge of generally accepted accounting  principles and auditing standards to the planning, delivery, and management of  external audit programs. Exclusions Positions  excluded from the Comptrollership group are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one of the following activities is of primary  importance: the evaluation of actuarial liabilities and the  determination of premiums and contributions in respect of insurance, annuity  and pension plans; the  application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics  to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies,  forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or  sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs  and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of  statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and  interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic  policies and recommendations; the planning, development, delivery or  management of administrative and federal government policies, programs,  services or other activities directed to the public service; the provision of strategic advice on or the  planning, analysis, development, delivery or management of human resources  policies, programs, services and other activities; the  development, application or enforcement of standards and procedures, and  quality assurance pertaining to information technology processing systems and  activities. Internal Audit  (CT-IAU) subgroup Amendments # Date Amendment N/A 2019 New Comptrollership (CT) group    certificate created by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and    Employment Board (FPSLREB). CT group definition includes    the Internal Audit (CT-IAU) subgroup. N/A 2023 On the effective date of the    new CT group, September 28, 2023, the new CT-IAU job evaluation standard was    incorporated into the overall CT job evaluation standard. Introduction The Internal Audit subgroup job evaluation standard is built on a level  progression plan. It contains general information including an introduction,  the definition of the Internal Audit subgroup, job evaluation instructions, a  glossary, a level description chart, and benchmarks. Factors The 4 factors and their respective elements used in this plan are listed  below. The combined factors being evaluated do not describe all aspects of  internal audit work. The selected elements only deal with key characteristics that  distinguish the different levels of work. Skill Knowledge Analytical and critical thinking Communication Effort Physical effort Sensory effort Responsibility Decision making Working conditions Physical environment Psychological environment Benchmarks Benchmarks are provided to  exemplify the various levels of work found in the Internal Audit subgroup. Each  benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information pertaining to  the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. These benchmarks are an  integral part of the job evaluation standard and are provided to ensure  consistency in the application of the CT-IAU subgroup level description chart. Use of the standard There are 3 steps in the  application of this job evaluation standard: The job description is studied to ensure understanding of the work as a  whole. The job description is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the  duties and responsibilities of the job against the level description chart to  determine which level best corresponds, overall, with the duties and  responsibilities of the job; and The job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the level tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the levels above and below  the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level  selected. Subgroup definition The Internal Audit subgroup comprises positions that are primarily engaged in  planning, developing, conducting, or managing internal audit work, in  accordance with the internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to  assess the effectiveness of risk management, control or governance processes. Inclusions The  Internal Audit subgroup includes only those positions that have, as their  primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities: conducting  internal audits; developing,  interpreting, assessing, recommending, or revising internal audit practices,  guidelines, directives, or policies; supervising  or managing any of the above activities. Exclusions Positions  excluded from the Internal Audit subgroup are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary  importance: the  development of evaluation frameworks; or the planning or conduct of program  evaluations; the  conduct of administrative, support, coordination or liaison functions related  to audit committees or external assurance providers; the  development and implementation of initiatives for the benefit of the internal  audit community. Glossary High  complexity internal audits (Audits internes très complexes) : High complexity internal audits are those which involve multiple and  diverse entities, a complex set of policy and legal requirements, and typically  have high risk exposure such as political sensitivity and/or impact.  High complexity internal audits may involve a  multidisciplinary internal audit team.   High complexity does not necessarily equate to large internal audits;  there are large internal audits that are not complex. Internal  audit (Audit interne) : Internal  audit provides Deputy Heads with added assurance, independent from line  management, by assessing and contributing to the improvement of risk  management, control, and governance processes using a systematic and  disciplined approach. Internal  audit activities (Activités d’audit interne) : Term used  to capture both the internal audit operations and practice management streams  of work. Internal  audit operations (Opérations d’audit interne) : The planning, conduct,  reporting and follow-up of internal audit engagements performed in compliance  with the Internal Auditing Standards for the Government of Canada. These  operations must meet the professional standards required by the Office of the  Comptroller General and the Treasury Board Policy on Internal Audit and  are subject to review by the Departmental Audit Committee (DAC) and the  oversight of the Deputy Head. Internal  audit report (Rapport d’audit interne) : The result  of assurance services is a report, which must include the engagement's  objectives, scope, and context; the risks and opportunities for improvement  identified by the internal audit; the criteria applied in the internal audit;  the inclusion of applicable recommendations; a statement of conformance; and a  management action plan. Completed internal audit reports are defined as  internal audit reports that have been recommended by the audit committee and  approved by the Deputy Head. Low  complexity internal audits (Audits internes peu complexes) : Low complexity internal audits are well-defined and do not require  making major adaptations to an existing control framework. Practice  management (Gestion de la pratique) : This  function ensures that internal audit engagements are performed in conformity  with applicable policies, directives, and standards. The activities of this  function include, but are not limited to, quality assurance and improvement  programs; follow-up to management action plans in response to recommendation",

The standard is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The job evaluation standard for the EC group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of the occupational group, the rating elements in the job evaluation plan, the rating scale, and the level point boundaries. Point-rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value for each job is determined by the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators. Elements Nine elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the scope of work that may be present in EC jobs. Element weighting The importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements. Each element in the EC Classification Standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element. Elements Percentage of total points Maximum point values Decision making 21 210 Leadership and operational management 14 140 Communication 18 180 Knowledge of specialized fields 10.5 105 Contextual knowledge 10.5 105 Research and analysis 21 210 Physical effort 1.5 15 Sensory effort 1.0 10 Working conditions 2.5 25 Total 100.0% 1,000 Notes to raters Notes to raters describe the definition and design intent of the element. In some cases, the notes to raters will reference important links with other elements in the standard or give key definitions or caveats that must be considered to fully understand the element. Specific guidelines The specific guidelines, which follow the element rating scale, provide information on the structure and mechanics of the element, and elaborate on how to use the rating scale by providing clarification of each degree and indications of how to differentiate among degrees. Benchmark positions Benchmark descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications. The rating scales identify the benchmark position descriptions that exemplify each degree. These descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the rating scales. Use of the standard There are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the notes to raters, and specific guidelines. The description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the factor in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established. The point values for all elements are added to determine the tentative total point rating.

It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The classification standard for the FS group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, definition of the group and the rating scale. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators. Elements Eight elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in FS jobs. Element Weighting The importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements. Each element in the FS standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high.

Introduction This standard is to be used to  establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Information  Technology (IT) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023. It is a key  component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with  the program’s legislative and policy context. The IT job evaluation standard  is a point-rating plan consisting of the definition of the  group, introduction, overview of the job  evaluation standard, glossary of key terms, the notes to raters and element  rating scales, and benchmark job descriptions. Elements Seven elements are used in this  plan. These elements represent aspects of work that are common to all jobs and  important in the capture of the overall nature and value of IT work at each  level, as well as serve to differentiate amongst the levels. These elements  also reflect coverage of the four broad pay equity factors of Skill, Effort,  Responsibility and Working Conditions required by prevailing legislation and  guidelines on Equal Wages. Each element contains a  definition and a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work  present in IT jobs and are designed to fairly, objectively and fully measure  the relative value of IT jobs in a gender-neutral fashion. The elements in the  IT job evaluation plan are as follows: Critical Thinking and Analysis  (Skill and Effort) Leadership and Planning  (Responsibility) Technical Knowledge (Skill) Management Knowledge (Skill) Communication and Interaction  (Skill and Responsibility) Effort (Effort) Sensory Effort Physical Effort Work Environment (Working Conditions) Psychological Work Environment Physical Work Environment Notes  to raters The notes to raters describe how  the job evaluation plan works, guide interpretation, and facilitate accurate,  fair, and consistent application across the core public administration. Benchmarks Benchmarks are provided as  reference tools to exemplify the various levels of work found in the IT  Occupational Group. Each benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information  specific to the elements used in this job evaluation plan. These benchmarks are  an integral part of the job evaluation standard and provide examples of work at  the various element degrees. Use  of the job evaluation standard This IT job evaluation plan must be used in  conjunction with the notes to raters and the benchmarks. There are five steps  in the application of this job evaluation standard: The subject position job description is  studied, including all supporting organizational information, to ensure full  understanding of the work as a whole including work context. The relationship  of the subject position to other positions within the organization is  important. Allocation of the position to the occupational  group is decided by referring to the occupational group definition and  description of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees for each element are  determined by comparing the subject position with the degree descriptors in the  rating scales and referring to the notes to raters. The job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the degree tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the degrees above and below  the degree tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the selection. The point values for all elements are added to  determine the total point rating and resulting level. The position being rated is compared, as a  whole, to a benchmark with a similar rating pattern and comparable total points  as a check on the validity of the level selected. Overview of the  job evaluation standard The IT Job Evaluation Standard is  designed around five levels of work, reflecting business, organization design,  work design and workforce management realities as described by key business and  functional leaders charged with the design and management of IT organizations  and work. While there are a variety of distinct technology disciplines and  areas of expertise within the IT Occupational Group, the broad workforce  structure looks as follows: Figure 1:  Overview of the IT Job Evaluation Standard Figure 1 - Text version This figure  represents the roles of work within the IT job evaluation standard in relation  to the various classification levels. There are three  roles that can exist: one is individual contributor role; another is  project manager role; and the third is functional manager role. Jobs at IT-01 and  IT-02 are junior/developing level and working level and are uniquely individual  contributor role. Jobs at IT-03 can  be Technical Advisor in the individual contributor role or Project Lead in the  project management role or Team Lead in the functional management role. Jobs at IT-04 can  be Senior Advisor in the individual contributor role or Senior Project Manager  in the project management role or Manager in the functional management role. Jobs at IT-05 are  uniquely Director in the in the functional management role. Point rating plan This IT Job Evaluation Standard  is a point rating plan, meaning an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the ",

Group Definition The Welfare Programs (WP) classification of the Program and Administrative Services (PA) group comprises positions that are  primarily involved in the planning, development, delivery or management of administrative and federal government policies, programs, services or other activities directed to the public. Inclusions Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities: Inclusion 12 of the PA Group – the planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services or other activities dealing with the social development, settlement, adjustment and rehabilitation of groups, communities or individuals including the planning, development and delivery of welfare services; and Inclusion 15 of the PA Group – the leadership of any of the above-mentioned activities. Exclusions Positions excluded from the PA Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group. Part I: Job Evaluation Plan Introduction This standard describes the point rating plan to be used to evaluate jobs allocated to the WP classification of the PA Group. It consists of an introduction, general definitions and point rating scales. The BM position descriptions are located in Part II. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative value of jobs. It is particularly suited to heterogeneous occupational groups in which jobs consist of varied combinations of tasks. Essentially, point rating plans define characteristics or factors common to the jobs being evaluated. They define degrees of each factor and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the raters. All methods of job evaluation require the exercise of judgment and the orderly collection and analysis of information so that consistent judgments can be made. The point rating method facilitates rational discussion and resolution of differences in determining the relative worth of jobs. Allocation Guidelines The Group Definition provides statements of “Inclusions” that describe the primary duties assigned to positions related to the WP classification of the PA Group. These are the principal sources of reference when allocating positions to the classification. Consistent with these statements are the following descriptions of work assignments normally associated with WP . They are intended as a further aid to raters in determining the allocation of positions to the classification. Social Development Assignments are concerned with the development, application or supervision of programs to guide, advise, stimulate and encourage the social, political, cultural and economic development of Aboriginal people living within defined geographic boundaries and individuals. Veterans’ Welfare Services Assignments are concerned with the development, application, supervision and administration of a program to provide such services as social adjustment, rehabilitation, counselling, welfare or financial benefit services to meet the needs of veterans and their families. Emergency Welfare Services Assignments are concerned with the planning and coordination of emergency services where adequate services are not otherwise provided and with training programs and formulation of plans with foreign, provincial and municipal governments for an emergency service including clothing, lodging, registration and enquiry services. Correctional Services Assignments are concerned with the development, application and administration of programs in the parole and penitentiaries services, which include the counselling and guidance of parolees and inmates, analysis and evaluation of their rehabilitation and training needs, professional diagnostic and reporting services and the development and implementation of corrective and follow-up programs. Factors The combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs. They deal only with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished and that are useful in determining the relative value of jobs. Four factors are used in this plan. All the factors have more than one dimension and have been defined in terms of two or three related elements. The factors and elements are: Knowledge Education Experience Continuing Study Problem Solving Scope for Problem Solving Impact of Activities Responsibility for Contacts Nature of Contacts Persons Contacted Supervision Level of Employees Supervised Numbers Supervised Point Values The maximum point value assigned to each factor reflects its relative importance. Similarly, point values have been assigned to the degrees of the factors. Point values increase arithmetically as the degrees of the factor increase. The minimum point values for knowledge, problem solving and responsibility for contacts are one-fifth of the maximum value. The minimum value for supervision is one-tenth of the maximum value, although there will be positions where this factor does not apply. The ranges of point values are: Factor Minimum Points Maximum Points Knowledge Education and Experience 60 300 Continuing Study 10 50 Problem Solving 70 350 Responsibility for Contacts 30 150 Supervision N/A 150 Total 170 1,000 BM Positions BM position descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each factor or element. Each description consists of a brief summary, a list of the principal duties and a specification describing each of the point rating factors and elements as it appears in the job. The BM positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each factor are shown in the specifications. The rating scales identify the BM position descriptions that exemplify each degree. These descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the rating scales. Use of the Standard There are six steps in the application of this classification standard. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of each factor. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the WP classification within the PA group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees of each factor in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of factors and the notes to raters. The description of the factor in each of the BM positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the factor in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descri",

Under Section 5 of the Department of Justice Act , the Minister of Justice, as Attorney General of Canada, is the chief law officer of the Crown. As per the Department of Justice Act , the Department supports the Attorney General of Canada who “ shall advise the heads of departments of the Government on al l matters of law connected with such departments ” and “ shall have the regulation and conduct all litigation for or against the Crown or any department, in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of Canada .” These services include providing legal advice, preparing legal documents, drafting legislation, and regulating or conducting litigation for or against the Crown or any department. The Department of Justice assures overall consistency and integrity of legal services for the federal government. As such, the Department of Justice holds the exclusive authority to approve the provision of legal services, except for those organizations whose enabling legislation includes the authority to provide legal services or legal advice. All organizations in the core public administration must consult the Department of Justice before creating any new LC positions. Law Management Occupational Group Definition Definition The Law Management occupational group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of the law and its practice in the management of legal functions, with accountability for exercising delegated authority over human and financial resources. Inclusions Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for the following activities: providing legal advice on the development, direction, conduct or management of programs or services; and managing legal programs or services and determining the nature and priority of objectives and resources committed to their achievement within and across organizations. Exclusions Positions excluded from the Law Management occupational group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group. Introduction This standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Law Management (LC) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The LC job evaluation standard is a point rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of the group, the rating scale and the point boundaries, the element characteristics associated with each level, the benchmark positions and the notes to raters. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative value of jobs. Point rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators. Elements Six elements are used in this evaluation plan. Each element is designed as a continuum of value that contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels at which the aspect of work is present in law management jobs. Element Weighting In a point rating classification tool, each element is given a relative weight indicating its relative importance to the overall value of work for the target population. This weight translates into a range of points that can be granted under that element. Each element is subdivided into levels, or degrees, to each a specific point value is assigned, and is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The value of a given job using this system is measured by totaling the points corresponding to the degrees assigned within each element. The weights corresponding to the Law Management group evaluation plan are as follows: Element Percentage of Total Points Maximum Point Value 1. Knowledge 27.0 % 270 2. Critical Thinking and Analysis 27.0 % 270 3. Relationship Building and Influence 14.5% 145 4. Leadership and Management 27.0% 270 5. Physical and Sensory Effort 1.5% 15 6. Work Environment 3.0% 30 Total: 100.0% 1,000 Benchmark Position Descriptions Benchmark position descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and the relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the element ratings. Use of the Standard There are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the occupational group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the application guidelines. The description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the element in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established. The point values for all elements are added up to determine the total point rating. The position being rated is compared as a whole to benchmark positions to which similar total point values have been assigned, as a check on the validity of the total rating. Appendix A: Use of the Application Guidelines The Law Management occupational group application guidelines have been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the LC job evaluation standard in order to accurately, fairly and consistently evaluate LC work. The application guidelines are a reference tool and must be used in conjunction with the LC job evaluation standard. In case of a discrepancy between the job evaluation standard and the application guidelines in the appendix, the job evaluation standard will take precedence. The application guidelines may be updated as required. Point Rating Scale The distribution of points across each element in the Law Management evaluation plan is presented below in the point rating table. Degree 1 Knowledge 2 Critical Thinking & Analysis 3 Relationship Building & Influence 4 Leadership & Management 5a Physical and Sensory Effort A 5b Physical and Sensory Effort B 5c Physical and Sensory Effort C 6a Psychological Work Environment 6b Physical Work Environment 1 27 27 15 27 2 2 2 5 1 2 96 96 67 96 5 5 5 15 10 3 166 166 145 166 n/a n/a n/a 20 n/a 4 270 270 n/a 270 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a % Total 27.0% 27.0% 14.5% 27.0% 0.5% 0.5% 0.5% 2.0% 1.0% 1.5% 3.0% Classification Level Point Boundaries The following table illustrates the minimum and maximum points for each level. Classification Level Point Minimum Point Maximum Point Spread 1 100 300 200 2 301 525 225 3 526 750 225 4 751 1,000 250 Element 1: Knowledge (Skill) This element measures a combination of the level of subject-matter knowledge of the law and its practice, contextual knowledge of the legal, policy, operational and socio-political environments, as well as the levels of strategic and operational knowledge of management principles and their application required to perform at increasing levels of management in the organization. Increasing levels of knowledge are typically acquired through education and experience within and outside the organization. Degree Degree Descriptor Points and Benchmarks 1 Requires an in-depth knowledge of a number of areas of law or practice particularly with respect to assigned areas of work including, knowledge of legal practices and processes and their application, clients' business, partners, and the legal and broader business environments within which the job operates. Requires sound knowledge of management principles, processes ",

Under Section 5 of the Department of Justice Act , the Minister of Justice, as Attorney General of Canada, is the chief law officer of the Crown. As per the Department of Justice Act , the Department supports the Attorney General of Canada who “ shall advise the heads of departments of the Government on all matters of law connected with such departments ” and “ shall have the regulation and conduct all litigation for or against the Crown or any department, in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of Canada .” These services include providing legal advice, preparing legal documents, drafting legislation, and regulating or conducting litigation for or against the Crown or any department. The Department of Justice assures overall consistency and integrity of legal services for the federal government. As such, the Department of Justice holds the exclusive authority to approve the provision of legal services, except for those organizations whose enabling legislation includes the authority to provide legal services or legal advice. All organizations in the core public administration must consult with the Department of Justice before creating any new LP positions. Law Practitioner Occupational Group Definition Definition The Law Practitioner occupational group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of the law and its practice to the performance of legal functions. Inclusions Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities: The provision of legal advice and legal services; The drafting of legislation, including regulations and Orders in Council; The conduct of litigation and prosecution; The provision of legal policy work and law reform work in the areas of responsibility of the Minister of Justice; and The provision of legal research and legal editing services. Exclusions Positions excluded from the Law Practitioner occupational group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group. Also excluded are positions that require the interpretation of regulations; the drafting of contracts, leases or other legal documents; or the conduct of studies in which a comprehensive knowledge of law is desirable but not mandatory. Introduction This standard is  to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Law  Practitioner (LP) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023.  It is a key component of the classification program  and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy  context. The job evaluation standard for  the  LP  group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of  the    group,  the rating scale, level point boundaries, element characteristics, benchmark  position descriptions, and applications guidelines. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define  characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees  of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value  determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the  evaluators. Elements Six elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in law practitioner jobs. Element weighting The importance of the work characteristics in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements. Each element in the Law Practitioner group job evaluation standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element. Element Percentage of Total Points Maximum Point Value Critical Thinking and Analysis 30.0% 300 Knowledge 30.0% 300 Communication and Interaction 21.0% 210 Leadership 15.0% 150 Physical and Sensory Effort 1.5% 15 Work environment 2.5% 25 Total 100.0% 1,000 Benchmark Position Descriptions Benchmark position descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and the relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the element ratings. Use of the Standard There are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the occupational group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the application guidelines. The description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the element in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established. The point values for all elements are added up to determine the total point rating. The position being rated is compared as a whole to benchmark positions to which similar total point values have been assigned, as a check on the validity of the total rating. Appendix A: Use of the Application Guidelines The Law Practitioner (LP) occupational group application guidelines have been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the LP job evaluation standard in order to accurately, fairly and consistently evaluate LP work. The application guidelines are a reference tool and must be used in conjunction with the LP job evaluation standard. In case of a discrepancy between the job evaluation standard and the application guidelines in the appendix, the job evaluation standard will take precedence. The application guidelines may be updated as required. Point-Rating Scale The table below shows the distribution of points allocated to each element.

Work at this level will enable legal officers to qualify for membership in the law societies of one of the provinces or territories of Canada, including the Chambre des notaires du Québec. Work at this level is performed under the supervision of a principal (law manager or law practitioner), who is a member of the law societies of one of the Canadian provinces or territories. It involves the performance of a variety of duties such as: conducting legal research; writing legal memoranda and other communications; drafting legal documents; participating in the preparation and conduct of cases, negotiations or mediations, interviews or meetings; analyzing problems based on law and facts and recommending options for resolution; or any other activity required by the particular law society concerned. LP-00 is the designated group and level to be used to",

Table of Contents Introduction Group Definition Knowledge Factor Problem Solving/Decision Making Factor Accountability Factor Communications Requirement Factor Illustrative Position Descriptions Index Introduction This standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level of work  allocated to the Applied Science and Patent Examination - Applied Science (SP-SCI)  subgroup evaluated using the Meteorology (MT) job evaluation standard effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of the classification program and must  be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The MT job evaluation  standard is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, definition of  the MT classification of the SC-SCI subgroup, rating scales and illustrative  position descriptions. Point rating is an analytical,  quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating  plans define characteristics or factors common to the jobs being evaluated,  define degrees of each factor, and allocate point values to each degree. The  total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by  the raters. All methods of job evaluation  require the exercise of judgement and the orderly collection and analysis of  information in order that consistent judgements can be made. The point-rating  method facilitates rational discussion and resolution of differences in  determining the relative values of jobs. Factors Four factors are used in this plan, each of the factors having two elements. The factors and elements do not necessarily describe all aspects of the positions; they deal only with those characteristics that are useful in measuring and determining the relative value of positions. Each of the elements is divided into degrees. Each degree description indicates a level of work difficulty in respect to the characteristics of the element, and successive degrees represent significant escalations into the scale of relative work difficulty. Factor, Element and Degree Weighting The importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing relative difficulty is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the factors and elements. The points assigned to the degree coordinates of the factors and elements increase in geometric progression from the minimum to maximum point value. Rating Scales Factor Element Percent of Factor Weight Minimum Points Maximum Points Knowledge Depth of knowledge Breadth of practical application 35% 35 350 Problem solving/decision making Complexity Impact on end results 30% 30 300 Accountability Supervisory/managerial responsibility Freedom to act 25% 25 250 Communications requirements Oral and/or written communications Human relations skills 10% 10 100 Descriptive Examples of Factor Degree Coordinates (Illustrative Position Descriptions) This standard does not contain benchmark positions in the traditional sense. However, in order to exemplify the degree coordinates of the two elements in any one of the four factors, illustrative position descriptions (IPDs) containing descriptive examples of the various degree coordinates have been provided. These illustrative position descriptions have been carefully selected to represent, within practical limitations, the full range of meteorological positions. These illustrative position descriptions, with their descriptive examples of factor degree coordinates, are an integral part of the classification plan and should be used to ensure consistency in the application of the rating scales. The descriptive examples are part of \"live\" position descriptions and, as such, will be updated and replaced as necessary. Use of the Standard There are six steps in the application of this classification standard. One of the important steps in the application of this standard is to ensure that the information being used to evaluate a given position is complete. It must include reference to the specific characteristics of work described in the factors as they relate to the duties of the position. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole, and of each factor. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation for the position to the category and the group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. Tentative degrees of each factor in the position being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the Factor Definitions, the Notes to Raters and to the Descriptive Examples of Element Degree contained in the illustrative position descriptions. The description of the factor degree coordinate in any one of the descriptive examples exemplifying the degree tentatively established, is compared with the factor statement in the position being rated and also with descriptive examples having degrees above an below the one tentatively established. The point values for all factors are added to determine the tentative total point rating. As a check on the validity of the total rating, the position being rated is compared as a whole with positions to which similar total point values have been assigned. Determination of Levels The ultimate objective of job evaluation is to determine the relative value of jobs in each occupational group in order that employees carrying out the jobs may be paid at rates consistent with the relationship indicated. Jobs that fall within a designated range of point values will be regarded as of equal difficulty and value and will be allocated to the same level. Point Boundaries Level Points MT -1 Formal meteorological instruction MT -2 100 – 133 MT -3 134 – 170 MT -4 171 – 217 MT -5 218 – 295 MT -6 296 – 400 MT -7 401 – 543 MT -8 544 – 737 MT -9 738 – 1,000 Group Definition Pursuant to paragraph 11.1(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act, the Treasury Board of Canada hereby provides notice that the definition of the Applied Science and Engineering Group, effective March 18, 1999, as published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on March 27, 1999, is amended and replaced by the following definition that shall apply to the Applied Science and Patent Examination ( SP ) Group as well as the Applied Science ( SP - SCI ) and Patent Examination ( SP - PEB ) Sub-groups, effective May 16, 2005.

It is a key  component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with  the program’s legislative and policy context. This standard describes the plan  used to evaluate positions allocated to the NU classification of the SH group.  It consists of an introduction,  and definitions  of the NU classification and the Hospital Nursing, Community Health Nursing,  and Medical Adjudicator Nursing subgroups. The ultimate objective of job evaluation is the  determination of the relative value of jobs in each occupational group. In  2010, the Medical Adjudicator subgroup was added to the NU job evaluation  standard. Organization  of the Standard Hospital  Nursing Sub-group and Community Health Nursing Sub-group A classification plan  of eight levels representing significant differences in the difficulty of the work  has been established for these sub-groups. Jobs assigned to a given level are  regarded as being of equivalent difficulty. Developmental Level (Level  Description) Using a level description, a developmental level at level one  has been established in the Hospital Nursing Sub-group and the Community Health  Nursing Sub-group to accommodate the positions where the work is carried out  under guidance of a senior nurse and from which, subsequently, incumbents are  usually appointed to an operating level. Factors The evaluation of positions at levels 2 to 8 and their  assignment to a classification level will be determined by the application of  three factors: Professional Complexity and Responsibility; Responsibility for Management and Management Advisory Service; Impact. Each factor is described, and the descriptions designate the  features of the work assigned to positions allocated to the sub-groups. A list  of characteristics is included for each factor. The characteristics indicate  the features of the work that are to be considered when evaluating a position  under a particular factor. The factor characteristics serve to ensure that  consideration is given to all features of the work of a position. Benchmark Positions Benchmark position descriptions exemplify degrees 2 to 8 of each  factor and levels 2 to 8 of the classification plan. Each benchmark consists of  a descriptive title, a statement of the principal duties and a set of  specifications describing the features of the work of the position in terms of  the characteristics of each of the three factors. The specifications exemplify  the application of the evaluation plan to the duties and responsibilities of  the benchmark position and indicate the degree assigned to the position for  each factor. A classification level is assigned to each benchmark position. Use of the Standard There are six steps in the application of the classification  standard for these two sub-groups: The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the characteristics of each factor. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the group and sub-group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. A degree under each factor is tentatively assigned to the position being evaluated by considering the duties and responsibilities of the position in relation to the range described for each factor characteristic and the degree highlights for the factor; and determining that the difficulty of work is equivalent to or greater or less than a degree that is described. The features of the work of the position being evaluated should be related to the degree highlight as a whole in its total context, not to isolated words or phrases. The degree tentatively assigned is confirmed by comparison with the benchmark position descriptions. The level of the position is determined by the degree that has been assigned to the position for at least two of the three factors. When one degree does not predominate, evaluators are to compare the total job with the benchmark position descriptions and determine the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position. The position is compared with benchmark position  descriptions that have been assigned to the same level, as a check on the  validity of the level selected. Medical Adjudicator Nursing Sub-group A classification plan of two levels  representing significant differences in the difficulty of the work has been  established for this sub-group. Jobs assigned to a given level are regarded as  being of equivalent difficulty. Example of  Work Activities Example of Work Activities demonstrates  levels 1 and 2 of the Medical Adjudicator classification plan. Each Example of  Work Activities consists of the principal duties and work performed for the  level described. A classification level is assigned to each Example of Work  Activities. Use of the  Standard There are five steps in the application of  this classification standard to this sub-group. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the Example of Work Activities. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. Allocation of the position to the group and sub-group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. A level is tentatively assigned to the position being evaluated by considering the Example of Work Activities in relation to the work description and choosing the level that best describes the duties and the responsibilities of the position. The features of the work of the position being evaluated should be related to the level highlight as a whole in its total context, not to isolated words or phrases. When one level does not predominate, evaluators are to compare the total job with the Example of Work Activities descriptions and determine the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position. The position is compared with other positions with similar work duties as a check on the validity of the level selected. Group Definition The Nursing ( NU ) classification within the Health Services ( SH ) Group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the field of nursing to the physical and mental well-being of people. Inclusions Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities: Inclusion 7 of the SH Group – the assessment of medical information for the purposes of determining eligibility of applicants for a government program requiring knowledge associated with a registered nurse; Inclusion 8 of the SH Group – the care of patients and the treatment and management of illness in cooperation with medical doctors, and the provision of specialized nursing services; Inclusion 9 of the SH Group – the evaluation of nursing policies, procedures, standards and practices and the conduct of related research and education; Inclusion 17 of the SH Group – the provision of advice in the above fields; and Inclusion 18 of the SH Group – the leadership of any of the above activities.

It is  a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction  with the program’s legislative and policy context. The ND job evaluation standard  describes the evaluation plan to be used to determine the level of jobs  allocated to the Nutrition and Dietetics classification of the SH group,  comprising the Advisory, Dietitian and Home Economist subgroups. It consists of  an introduction and definitions of  the classification  and the three subgroups. The standard also includes level descriptions and  benchmark position descriptions for each subgroup. The level description method of  job evaluation is used to classify jobs allocated to the subgroups. The levels  in the classification plan for each subgroup are described in terms of the  primary features to be considered in assigning jobs to a level. Jobs are  regarded as being of equal value when they best correspond, on the whole, with  the description of a level and the benchmark position description exemplifying  that level. Benchmark Positions Benchmark position descriptions exemplify each level. Each description consists of a summary and an explanation of the distinguishing features of the position. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the three plans and are to be used to ensure consistency in applying the level descriptions. Use of the Standard Four steps are to be followed in applying this classification standard: The allocation of the position to the category, group and sub-group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position within the organizational setting is also studied. The position is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of the position with the level descriptions of the appropriate sub-group. The position is tentatively assigned to the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position. The description of the position being evaluated is compared with the benchmark position description illustrating the level tentatively selected, and comparisons are made with the benchmark position descriptions illustrating the levels above and below the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level selected.

It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context. The PO group is comprised of two subgroups: the Telecommunications Operations and the Intercept Monitoring and Analysis, each with its own job evaluation plan. The present document contains the two evaluation plans used to establish the relative value of jobs allocated to the PO group. For ease of reference, this document is divided into various sections. The first few sections contain general information such as overall PO group definition. The subsequent sections deal with the two subgroups separately. Specifically, for each subgroup, there are sections containing the subgroup definition, a glossary, notes to raters, a level progression chart and benchmark position descriptions. Factors Four factors are used in this plan and their respective elements are listed below. The combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs. Selected factors and elements deal with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished and that are useful in determining the relative value of jobs. Skills Knowledge and Skills Effort Physical Effort Intellectual Effort Responsibility Technical Responsibilities Human Resource and Financial Responsibilities Working Conditions Physical Environment Psychological Environment Benchmark Position Descriptions Benchmark position descriptions are used to exemplify the various levels of work found in each sub-group. Each description consists of a list of key activities and specifications providing information pertaining to the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. The benchmark position descriptions have been evaluated and the level assigned is clearly identified. These benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the evaluation plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the level progression chart. Use of the Standard Allocation of the position to the group is confirmed by reference to the intent of the occupational group and sub-group definitions and the review of their respective inclusions and exclusions. There are three steps in the application of this classification standard. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being evaluated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied; The position is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of the position against the level progression chart and determining which level best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position; and The position description being evaluated is compared with the benchmark position descriptions illustrating the level tentatively selected, and comparisons are also made with the benchmark position descriptions for the levels above and below the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level selected.

Table of Contents Introduction Group Definition Psychology Factors Technical Complexity Professional Responsibility Management Responsibility Benchmark Position Description Index in Rating Order Benchmark Position Description Index in Alphabetical Order Introduction This  standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level of work allocated to  the Health Services (SH) occupational group evaluated using the Psychology (PS)  job evaluation standard effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of  the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context. This standard describes the plan  to be used to classify positions allocated to the PS classification of the SH  group. It consists of an introduction, definitions of the classification,  factor definitions and characteristics, rating scales and benchmark position  descriptions. A five-level classification plan  has been established for this occupational group. These levels represent  significant differences in the difficulty of the work. The evaluation of positions and  their assignment to a classification level will be determined by the application  of three factors: Technical complexity Professional responsibility Management responsibility The factors selected deal with  most features of the work assigned to positions in the PS classification of the  SH group. A definition and a list of factor characteristics have been included  for each factor. The characteristics indicate the features of the work that are  to be considered when evaluating a position under a particular factor. Each  characteristic describes the lowest and the highest requirement. The factor  characteristics serve to ensure that consideration is given to all features of  the work of a position. Because of the nature and  diversity of positions in PS classification of the SH group, it was not  considered possible to produce meaningful definitions for all degrees of the  factors that would demonstrate the increasing complexity of the work from the  lowest to the highest degree. As a result, degree definitions have been  included for the second and fourth degrees only. These degree definitions  highlight the features of the work that will be found in most positions at  these degrees. The degrees of each factor are illustrated by one or more  benchmark position descriptions. Determination of Levels The level of a position is determined by the degree assigned for at least two of the three factors. When one degree does not predominate, raters are to compare the total job with benchmark position descriptions and determine the level by ranking the position against appropriate benchmarks. The ultimate objective of job evaluation is the determination of the relative values of jobs in each occupational group. Jobs assigned to a given level in an occupational group are regarded as being of equal difficulty. Benchmark Positions Benchmark position descriptions exemplify the degrees of each factor and the levels of the classification structure. Each benchmark consists of a descriptive title, a brief summary, a statement of the principal duties with the percentage of time devoted to each, and a set of specifications. The specifications describe the features of the work of the position in terms of the characteristics of each of the three factors and indicate the degree assigned to the position for each factor. The specifications exemplify the application of the evaluation plan to the duties and responsibilities of the benchmark position. A classification level is assigned to each benchmark position. Use of the Standard There are five steps in the application of this classification standard. Allocation of the position to the category and group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the characteristics of each factor. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied. A degree of each factor is tentatively assigned to the position being evaluated by considering the factor characteristics identified in the duties of the position and comparing them with the degree definitions. Degrees are assigned for each factor by determining that the characteristics of the position are equal to, more than, or less than a degree that is defined. The degree tentatively selected is confirmed by comparison with the benchmark position descriptions. The final rating of the position is determined by the degree that has been assigned to the position for at least two of the three factors. The position is compared with benchmark position descriptions that have been assigned to the same level, as a check on the validity of the level selected. Group Definition The Psychology (PS) classification of the Health Services (SH) Group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the field of psychology to the physical and mental well-being of people. Inclusions Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities: Inclusion 14 of the SH group – the conduct of research in human behaviour, the assessment of human motives, abilities, skills, decisions and acts, and the treatment of human behaviour; Inclusion 17 of the SH group – the provision of advice in the above fields; and Inclusion 18 of the SH group – the leadership of any of the above activities. Exclusions Positions excluded from the Psychology (PS) classification of the Health Services (SH) Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group. Also excluded are positions that: Exclusion 1 of the SH group – do not require the application of a comprehensive knowledge of psychology. Psychology Factors Technical Complexity This factor is used to measure the difficulty of the work in terms of the use of approaches, methods and techniques; the interrelationships and the subtlety of variable factors that must be taken into account; and the required knowledge of the discipline, associated disciplines or functions, and departmental policy. When evaluating positions under this factor, raters are to consider the following characteristics: The use of approaches, methods and techniques will range from applying, with some adaptation, established methods and techniques to meet the requirements of the work, to developing and applying new approaches, methods and techniques to meet the changing requirements of a program. The interrelationships and subtlety of variable factors to be taken into account will range from work that involves a number of variable factors with straightforward interrelationships, to work that involves a large number of subtle interacting variables difficult to define and quantify. The required knowledge of the discipline, associated disciplines or functions and departmental policy will range from a good knowledge of the theory, principles and techniques of a psychological specialty, with a specific knowledge of a particular aspect of the specialty, and knowledge of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines or functions, to an authoritative knowledge of the discipline and a comprehensive knowledge of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines and functions and of regulations and policies governing the department or government program. Technical Complexity Rating Scale Degree Description Benchmark 1 N/A BM 1 2 The work requires the modification and adaptation of established methods and techniques and the development of new approaches and techniques to meet variations in the needs of clients or projects. It requires the analysis of a large number of subtle interacting variables. The work requires a thorough knowledge of the theory, principles and techniques of a psychological specialty and continuing study of current trends and developments. It also requires a good understanding of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines and functions and of the programs and regulations of the department or institution. BM 2 3 N/A BM 3 4 The work requires originality and imagination in developing new methods and techniques to address complex problems and in planning and developing new procedures and studies to meet the changing requirements of departmental or institutional programs. The work requires the application of a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of the theory, principles and techniques of a psychological specialty and of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines and functions. It requires a thorough knowledge of the regulations and policies governing the departmental or institutional programs. BM 4 5 N/A BM 5 Professional Responsibility This factor is used to measure the difficulty of the work in terms of the nature of the controls exercised over the work, the responsibility for making interpretations, decisions and recommendations, giving training in psychological principles and techniques, and providing advice. When evaluating positions under this factor, raters are to consider the ",

Inclusions Notwithstanding  the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions  that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the  following activities: Inclusion  15 of the SH Group – the promotion of individual, group and community well-being  through the identification and assessment of social needs; and the planning,  development and delivery and management of social programs and social work  services with the objective of lessening, removing or preventing the physical,  emotional and material problems of individuals, families or groups; Inclusion  17 of the SH Group – the provision of advice in the above fields; and Inclusion  18 of the SH Group – the leadership of any of the above activities. Exclusions Positions excluded from the Health Services Group are those  whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those  in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance: Exclusion 3 of the SH group – the  planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services  or other activities dealing with the social development, settlement, adjustment  and rehabilitation of groups, communities or individuals, including the  planning, development and delivery of welfare services. Also excluded are positions that: Exclusion 1 of the SH Group – do not  require the application of a comprehensive knowledge of social work. Chaplain Sub-group Introduction This standard describes the classification plan used to  determine the relative difficulty of jobs allocated to the Chaplain Sub-group.  It consists of an introduction, definitions of the Sub-group and level  descriptions. The level description method is used to classify jobs  allocated to the Chaplain Sub-group. Each of the levels in the classification  plan is described in terms of the primary features used to assign Jobs to the  level. Jobs are regarded as being of equal difficulty and are assigned to the  same level when the duties and responsibilities best correspond, on the whole,  with the description of that level. Use of the Standard Three steps are to be followed in applying this  classification standard. The position description  is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of  the position being evaluated to positions above and below it in the  organization is also studied. The  allocation of the position to the category and group is confirmed by reference  to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions. The position is  tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of  the position with the level descriptions. The position is tentatively assigned  to the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and  responsibilities of the position. Sub-group  Definition The identification and assessment of individual and group  religious and spiritual needs; the provision of advice and counselling service  to patients and inmates. The conducting of divine services and religious  exercises; the provision of spiritual consolidation to hospital patients; the organization  of inmate programs in collaboration with the social development staff and members  of outside communities; the provision of religious education to patients,  inmates and staff; the arranging for material assistance for patients and  inmates during periods of adjustment and rehabilitation; the provision of  training and assessment programs directed towards the development of clinical  pastoral education; the planning, organizing and coordination of chaplaincy  activities on regional and national bases. Inclusion Positions included in the sub-group are those that  involve the performance of chaplaincy duties. Level Description Level 1 This level includes those positions whose duties include  the conducting of divine services and religious exercises for, and providing  pastoral counselling to hospital patients. In addition, the work requires the  provision of advice and assistance to the patients’ families. Level 2 This level includes positions whose duties include the  provision or the coordination of pastoral counselling and assistance to inmates  and their families and to the staff of the institutions; the implementation of  religious rehabilitation programs; the communicating of offender needs to the  community and of the role of the institution and the public in helping inmates  re-enter the community. Level 3 This level includes positions whose duties include the  regional coordination of spiritual programs and activities; the provision of  consultation, administration, pastoral planning and liaison services; the  integration of chaplaincy services between the institution and the community;  the development and coordination of religious programs and the monitoring of  the needs of the inmate populations; the assessing of training needs and the  facilitation of training programs for the region; the representation of the  chaplaincy service at conferences, seminars, etc. Social Welfare Sub-group Introduction The classification standard  for the Social Welfare Sub-group is a point rating plan consisting of an  introduction, definition of the sub-group, rating scales and benchmark position  descriptions. Point rating is an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the relative values of jobs. Point rating plans define  characteristics of factors common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees  of each factor and allocate point values to each degree. The total value  determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the raters. All methods of job evaluation require the exercise of  judgment and the orderly collection and analysis of information in order that  consistent judgments can be made. The point rating method facilitates rational  discussion and resolution of differences in determining the relative values of  jobs. Factors The combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs.  They deal only with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished  and that are useful in determining the relative worth of jobs. Three factors are used in this plan. One of the factors  is two-dimensional and has been defined in terms of two related elements. Factor Weighting and Point Distribution The  weighting of each factor reflects its relative importance. Similarly, points  are distributed to the factors or elements in an arithmetic progression. Rating Scales In the  rating plan the following factors, factor, weights and point values are used. Factor Element Minimum Points Maximum Points Percentage of Total Points Knowledge N/A 60 300 30 Professional Responsibility Requirement for Initiative and Judgment 80 400 40 Impact of Activities Administrative Responsibility N/A 60 300 15 Total 200 1,000 100 Benchmark Positions Benchmark position  descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of factors. Each description consists  of a list of the principal duties with the percentage of time devoted to each,  and specifications describing the degree of each factor to which the position  is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point  values assigned for each factor are shown in the specifications. The rating scales  identify the Benchmark position descriptions that exemplify each degree. These  descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to  ensure consistency in applying the rating scales. Use of the Standard There are  six steps in the application of this classification standard. The position des",
