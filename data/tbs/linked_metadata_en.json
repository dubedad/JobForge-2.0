It is a key component of the  classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context.\n\nThe positions  allocated to the CT occupational group are divided into three subgroups:\n\nInternal  Audit (CT-IAU)\n\nFinancial  Management (CT-FIN)\n\nExternal  Audit (CT-EAV)\n\nThis standard replaces the following job evaluation  standards: Management (FI) 2016, and Auditing (AU) 1987, and amends the Administrative Services (AS) 1965.\n\nThe Comptrollership group comprises positions that are  primarily engaged in internal audits, financial management and external audits.\n\nThe Comptrollership group includes only  those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one of  the following activities:\n\nplanning,  developing, conducting or managing internal audit work, in accordance with the  internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to assess the effectiveness  of risk management, control or governance processes;\n\nplanning,  development, analysis, delivery or management of internal public service  financial policies, programs, services or other related activities;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of generally accepted accounting  principles and auditing standards to the planning, delivery, and management of  external audit programs.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Comptrollership group are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe evaluation of actuarial liabilities and the  determination of premiums and contributions in respect of insurance, annuity  and pension plans;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics  to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies,  forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or  sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs  and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of  statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and  interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic  policies and recommendations;\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or  management of administrative and federal government policies, programs,  services or other activities directed to the public service;\n\nthe provision of strategic advice on or the  planning, analysis, development, delivery or management of human resources  policies, programs, services and other activities;\n\nthe  development, application or enforcement of standards and procedures, and  quality assurance pertaining to information technology processing systems and  activities.\n\nNew Comptrollership (CT) group    certificate created by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and    Employment Board (FPSLREB).\n\nCT group definition includes    the Internal Audit (CT-IAU) subgroup.\n\nOn the effective date of the    new CT group, September 28, 2023, the new CT-IAU job evaluation standard was    incorporated into the overall CT job evaluation standard.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup job evaluation standard is built on a level  progression plan. It contains general information including an introduction,  the definition of the Internal Audit subgroup, job evaluation instructions, a  glossary, a level description chart, and benchmarks.\n\nThe 4 factors and their respective elements used in this plan are listed  below.\n\nThe combined factors being evaluated do not describe all aspects of  internal audit work.

Each  benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information pertaining to  the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. These benchmarks are an  integral part of the job evaluation standard and are provided to ensure  consistency in the application of the CT-IAU subgroup level description chart.\n\nThere are 3 steps in the  application of this job evaluation standard:\n\nThe job description is studied to ensure understanding of the work as a  whole.\n\nThe job description is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the  duties and responsibilities of the job against the level description chart to  determine which level best corresponds, overall, with the duties and  responsibilities of the job; and\n\nThe job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the level tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the levels above and below  the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level  selected.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup comprises positions that are primarily engaged in  planning, developing, conducting, or managing internal audit work, in  accordance with the internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to  assess the effectiveness of risk management, control or governance processes.\n\nThe  Internal Audit subgroup includes only those positions that have, as their  primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nconducting  internal audits;\n\ndeveloping,  interpreting, assessing, recommending, or revising internal audit practices,  guidelines, directives, or policies;\n\nsupervising  or managing any of the above activities.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Internal Audit subgroup are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe  development of evaluation frameworks; or the planning or conduct of program  evaluations;\n\nthe  conduct of administrative, support, coordination or liaison functions related  to audit committees or external assurance providers;\n\nthe  development and implementation of initiatives for the benefit of the internal  audit community.\n\nKnowledgeThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.Subject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.Contextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.It should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.\n\nSubject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.\n\nContextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.\n\nIt should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.Analytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.This element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.\n\nThis element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nDecision makingThis element  captures the level of complexity and the latitude available in decision making.Level of complexity  is challenging to measure in a consistent fashion si",

It is a key component of the  classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context.\n\nThe positions  allocated to the CT occupational group are divided into three subgroups:\n\nInternal  Audit (CT-IAU)\n\nFinancial  Management (CT-FIN)\n\nExternal  Audit (CT-EAV)\n\nThis standard replaces the following job evaluation  standards: Management (FI) 2016, and Auditing (AU) 1987, and amends the Administrative Services (AS) 1965.\n\nThe Comptrollership group comprises positions that are  primarily engaged in internal audits, financial management and external audits.\n\nThe Comptrollership group includes only  those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one of  the following activities:\n\nplanning,  developing, conducting or managing internal audit work, in accordance with the  internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to assess the effectiveness  of risk management, control or governance processes;\n\nplanning,  development, analysis, delivery or management of internal public service  financial policies, programs, services or other related activities;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of generally accepted accounting  principles and auditing standards to the planning, delivery, and management of  external audit programs.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Comptrollership group are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe evaluation of actuarial liabilities and the  determination of premiums and contributions in respect of insurance, annuity  and pension plans;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics  to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies,  forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or  sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs  and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of  statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and  interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic  policies and recommendations;\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or  management of administrative and federal government policies, programs,  services or other activities directed to the public service;\n\nthe provision of strategic advice on or the  planning, analysis, development, delivery or management of human resources  policies, programs, services and other activities;\n\nthe  development, application or enforcement of standards and procedures, and  quality assurance pertaining to information technology processing systems and  activities.\n\nNew Comptrollership (CT) group    certificate created by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and    Employment Board (FPSLREB).\n\nCT group definition includes    the Internal Audit (CT-IAU) subgroup.\n\nOn the effective date of the    new CT group, September 28, 2023, the new CT-IAU job evaluation standard was    incorporated into the overall CT job evaluation standard.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup job evaluation standard is built on a level  progression plan. It contains general information including an introduction,  the definition of the Internal Audit subgroup, job evaluation instructions, a  glossary, a level description chart, and benchmarks.\n\nThe 4 factors and their respective elements used in this plan are listed  below.\n\nThe combined factors being evaluated do not describe all aspects of  internal audit work. The selected elements only deal with key characteristics that  distinguish the different levels of work.\n\nSkillKnowledgeAnalytical and critical thinkingCommunication\n\nKnowledge\n\nAnalytical and critical thinking\n\nCommunication\n\nEffortPhysical effortSensory effort\n\nPhysical effort\n\nSensory effort\n\nResponsibilityDecision making\n\nDecision making\n\nWorking conditionsPhysical environmentPsychological environment\n\nPhysical environment\n\nPsychological environment\n\nBenchmarks are provided to  exemplify the various levels of work found in the Internal Audit subgroup. Each  benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information pertaining to  the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. These benchmarks are an  integral part of the job evaluation standard and are provided to ensure  consistency in the application of the CT-IAU subgroup level description chart.\n\nThere are 3 steps in the  application of this job evaluation standard:\n\nThe job description is studied to ensure understanding of the work as a  whole.\n\nThe job description is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the  duties and responsibilities of the job against the level description chart to  determine which level best corresponds, overall, with the duties and  responsibilities of the job; and\n\nThe job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the level tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the levels above and below  the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level  selected.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup comprises positions that are primarily engaged in  planning, developing, conducting, or managing internal audit work, in  accordance with the internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to  assess the effectiveness of risk management, control or governance processes.\n\nThe  Internal Audit subgroup includes only those positions that have, as their  primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nconducting  internal audits;\n\ndeveloping,  interpreting, assessing, recommending, or revising internal audit practices,  guidelines, directives, or policies;\n\nsupervising  or managing any of the above activities.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Internal Audit subgroup are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe  development of evaluation frameworks; or the planning or conduct of program  evaluations;\n\nthe  conduct of administrative, support, coordination or liaison functions related  to audit committees or external assurance providers;\n\nthe  development and implementation of initiatives for the benefit of the internal  audit community.\n\nKnowledgeThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.Subject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.Contextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.It should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.\n\nSubject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.\n\nContextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.\n\nIt should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.Analytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.This element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.\n\nThis element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nDecision makingThis element  captures the level of complexity and the latitude available in decision making.Level of complexity  is challenging to measure in a consistent fashion si",

It is a key component of the  classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context.\n\nThe positions  allocated to the CT occupational group are divided into three subgroups:\n\nInternal  Audit (CT-IAU)\n\nFinancial  Management (CT-FIN)\n\nExternal  Audit (CT-EAV)\n\nThis standard replaces the following job evaluation  standards: Management (FI) 2016, and Auditing (AU) 1987, and amends the Administrative Services (AS) 1965.\n\nThe Comptrollership group comprises positions that are  primarily engaged in internal audits, financial management and external audits.\n\nThe Comptrollership group includes only  those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one of  the following activities:\n\nplanning,  developing, conducting or managing internal audit work, in accordance with the  internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to assess the effectiveness  of risk management, control or governance processes;\n\nplanning,  development, analysis, delivery or management of internal public service  financial policies, programs, services or other related activities;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of generally accepted accounting  principles and auditing standards to the planning, delivery, and management of  external audit programs.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Comptrollership group are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe evaluation of actuarial liabilities and the  determination of premiums and contributions in respect of insurance, annuity  and pension plans;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics  to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies,  forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or  sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs  and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of  statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and  interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic  policies and recommendations;\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or  management of administrative and federal government policies, programs,  services or other activities directed to the public service;\n\nthe provision of strategic advice on or the  planning, analysis, development, delivery or management of human resources  policies, programs, services and other activities;\n\nthe  development, application or enforcement of standards and procedures, and  quality assurance pertaining to information technology processing systems and  activities.\n\nNew Comptrollership (CT) group    certificate created by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and    Employment Board (FPSLREB).\n\nCT group definition includes    the Internal Audit (CT-IAU) subgroup.\n\nOn the effective date of the    new CT group, September 28, 2023, the new CT-IAU job evaluation standard was    incorporated into the overall CT job evaluation standard.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup job evaluation standard is built on a level  progression plan. It contains general information including an introduction,  the definition of the Internal Audit subgroup, job evaluation instructions, a  glossary, a level description chart, and benchmarks.\n\nThe 4 factors and their respective elements used in this plan are listed  below.\n\nThe combined factors being evaluated do not describe all aspects of  internal audit work. The selected elements only deal with key characteristics that  distinguish the different levels of work.\n\nSkillKnowledgeAnalytical and critical thinkingCommunication\n\nKnowledge\n\nAnalytical and critical thinking\n\nCommunication\n\nEffortPhysical effortSensory effort\n\nPhysical effort\n\nSensory effort\n\nResponsibilityDecision making\n\nDecision making\n\nWorking conditionsPhysical environmentPsychological environment\n\nPhysical environment\n\nPsychological environment\n\nBenchmarks are provided to  exemplify the various levels of work found in the Internal Audit subgroup. Each  benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information pertaining to  the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. These benchmarks are an  integral part of the job evaluation standard and are provided to ensure  consistency in the application of the CT-IAU subgroup level description chart.\n\nThere are 3 steps in the  application of this job evaluation standard:\n\nThe job description is studied to ensure understanding of the work as a  whole.\n\nThe job description is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the  duties and responsibilities of the job against the level description chart to  determine which level best corresponds, overall, with the duties and  responsibilities of the job; and\n\nThe job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the level tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the levels above and below  the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level  selected.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup comprises positions that are primarily engaged in  planning, developing, conducting, or managing internal audit work, in  accordance with the internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to  assess the effectiveness of risk management, control or governance processes.\n\nThe  Internal Audit subgroup includes only those positions that have, as their  primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nconducting  internal audits;\n\ndeveloping,  interpreting, assessing, recommending, or revising internal audit practices,  guidelines, directives, or policies;\n\nsupervising  or managing any of the above activities.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Internal Audit subgroup are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe  development of evaluation frameworks; or the planning or conduct of program  evaluations;\n\nthe  conduct of administrative, support, coordination or liaison functions related  to audit committees or external assurance providers;\n\nthe  development and implementation of initiatives for the benefit of the internal  audit community.\n\nKnowledgeThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.Subject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.Contextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.It should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.\n\nSubject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.\n\nContextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.\n\nIt should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.Analytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.This element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.\n\nThis element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nDecision makingThis element  captures the level of complexity and the latitude available in decision making.Level of complexity  is challenging to measure in a consistent fashion si",

It is a key component of the  classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context.\n\nThe positions  allocated to the CT occupational group are divided into three subgroups:\n\nInternal  Audit (CT-IAU)\n\nFinancial  Management (CT-FIN)\n\nExternal  Audit (CT-EAV)\n\nThis standard replaces the following job evaluation  standards: Management (FI) 2016, and Auditing (AU) 1987, and amends the Administrative Services (AS) 1965.\n\nThe Comptrollership group comprises positions that are  primarily engaged in internal audits, financial management and external audits.\n\nThe Comptrollership group includes only  those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one of  the following activities:\n\nplanning,  developing, conducting or managing internal audit work, in accordance with the  internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to assess the effectiveness  of risk management, control or governance processes;\n\nplanning,  development, analysis, delivery or management of internal public service  financial policies, programs, services or other related activities;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of generally accepted accounting  principles and auditing standards to the planning, delivery, and management of  external audit programs.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Comptrollership group are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe evaluation of actuarial liabilities and the  determination of premiums and contributions in respect of insurance, annuity  and pension plans;\n\nthe  application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics  to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies,  forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or  sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs  and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of  statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and  interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic  policies and recommendations;\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or  management of administrative and federal government policies, programs,  services or other activities directed to the public service;\n\nthe provision of strategic advice on or the  planning, analysis, development, delivery or management of human resources  policies, programs, services and other activities;\n\nthe  development, application or enforcement of standards and procedures, and  quality assurance pertaining to information technology processing systems and  activities.\n\nNew Comptrollership (CT) group    certificate created by the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and    Employment Board (FPSLREB).\n\nCT group definition includes    the Internal Audit (CT-IAU) subgroup.\n\nOn the effective date of the    new CT group, September 28, 2023, the new CT-IAU job evaluation standard was    incorporated into the overall CT job evaluation standard.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup job evaluation standard is built on a level  progression plan. It contains general information including an introduction,  the definition of the Internal Audit subgroup, job evaluation instructions, a  glossary, a level description chart, and benchmarks.\n\nThe 4 factors and their respective elements used in this plan are listed  below.\n\nThe combined factors being evaluated do not describe all aspects of  internal audit work. The selected elements only deal with key characteristics that  distinguish the different levels of work.\n\nSkillKnowledgeAnalytical and critical thinkingCommunication\n\nKnowledge\n\nAnalytical and critical thinking\n\nCommunication\n\nEffortPhysical effortSensory effort\n\nPhysical effort\n\nSensory effort\n\nResponsibilityDecision making\n\nDecision making\n\nWorking conditionsPhysical environmentPsychological environment\n\nPhysical environment\n\nPsychological environment\n\nBenchmarks are provided to  exemplify the various levels of work found in the Internal Audit subgroup. Each  benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information pertaining to  the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. These benchmarks are an  integral part of the job evaluation standard and are provided to ensure  consistency in the application of the CT-IAU subgroup level description chart.\n\nThere are 3 steps in the  application of this job evaluation standard:\n\nThe job description is studied to ensure understanding of the work as a  whole.\n\nThe job description is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the  duties and responsibilities of the job against the level description chart to  determine which level best corresponds, overall, with the duties and  responsibilities of the job; and\n\nThe job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the level tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the levels above and below  the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level  selected.\n\nThe Internal Audit subgroup comprises positions that are primarily engaged in  planning, developing, conducting, or managing internal audit work, in  accordance with the internal audit policy of the Government of Canada, to  assess the effectiveness of risk management, control or governance processes.\n\nThe  Internal Audit subgroup includes only those positions that have, as their  primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nconducting  internal audits;\n\ndeveloping,  interpreting, assessing, recommending, or revising internal audit practices,  guidelines, directives, or policies;\n\nsupervising  or managing any of the above activities.\n\nPositions  excluded from the Internal Audit subgroup are those whose primary purpose is  included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more  certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary  importance:\n\nthe  development of evaluation frameworks; or the planning or conduct of program  evaluations;\n\nthe  conduct of administrative, support, coordination or liaison functions related  to audit committees or external assurance providers;\n\nthe  development and implementation of initiatives for the benefit of the internal  audit community.\n\nKnowledgeThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.Subject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.Contextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.It should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nThis element captures the subject matter knowledge and the contextual  knowledge required.\n\nSubject  matter knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the  standards, principles, and practices specific to the professional practice of  internal audit, as well as the knowledge of project management.\n\nContextual  knowledgerefers to the knowledge of the organizational  context and the machinery of government.\n\nIt should be noted that both types of knowledge do not always grow at  the same rate from one job to the next.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.Analytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.This element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nThis element  captures the requirement for analytical and critical thinking.\n\nAnalytical and critical thinkingvary with  the nature of the information, the multiplicity and diversity of sources of  information and the complexity of the analysis involved.\n\nThis element  does not measure the use of judgment; all CT-IAU position incumbents are  required to exercise sound professional judgment throughout the conduct of  internal audit activities.\n\nDecision makingThis element  captures the level of complexity and the latitude available in decision making.Level of complexity  is challenging to measure in a consistent fashion si",

The standard is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe job evaluation standard for the EC group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of the occupational group, the rating elements in the job evaluation plan, the rating scale, and the level point boundaries.\n\nPoint-rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value for each job is determined by the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators.\n\nNine elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the scope of work that may be present in EC jobs.\n\nThe importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements. Each element in the EC Classification Standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element.\n\nNotes to raters describe the definition and design intent of the element. In some cases, the notes to raters will reference important links with other elements in the standard or give key definitions or caveats that must be considered to fully understand the element.\n\nThe specific guidelines, which follow the element rating scale, provide information on the structure and mechanics of the element, and elaborate on how to use the rating scale by providing clarification of each degree and indications of how to differentiate among degrees.\n\nBenchmark descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications.\n\nThe rating scales identify the benchmark position descriptions that exemplify each degree. These descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the rating scales.\n\nThere are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nAllocation of the position to the group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the notes to raters, and specific guidelines.\n\nThe description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the factor in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established.\n\nThe point values for all elements are added to determine the tentative total point rating.\n\nThe position being rated is compared as a whole to positions to which similar total point values have been assigned, as a check on the validity of the total rating.\n\nThe Economics and Social Science Services Group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the conduct of surveys, studies and projects in the social sciences; the identification, description and organization of archival, library, museum and gallery materials; the editing of legislation or the provision of advice on legal problems in specific fields; and the application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics to the conduct of economic, socio-economic and sociological research, studies, forecasts and surveys; the research, analysis and evaluation of the economic or sociological effects of departmental or interdepartmental projects, programs and policies; the development, application, analysis and evaluation of statistical and survey methods and systems; and the development, analysis and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information and socio-economic policies and recommendations.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nthe conduct of surveys, studies, projects and tests requiring a practical knowledge of a specialized field such as economics, history, law or psychology and requiring the development of specialized techniques and procedures, or the development and use of related processing applications, or the interpretation of findings;\n\nthe identification, description, classification, organization and location of archival, gallery, library or museum materials; or the creation, manipulation, verification, analysis and transmission of descriptive records pertaining to such materials, both of which require a practical knowledge of the subject matter;\n\nthe editing of legislation or the conduct of studies in matters such as land conveyancing, expropriation, litigation and labour relations requiring a practical knowledge of the specific legal area to interpret findings or prepare submissions;\n\nthe application of a practical knowledge of a specialized field such as economics, history, law or psychology to the use and modification or adaptation of computer systems, utilities or software;\n\nthe application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics to economic, socio-economic or sociological studies, forecasts and surveys in a variety of subject areas in domestic and/or international settings;\n\nthe application of a comprehensive knowledge of economics, sociology or statistics to the development, application and evaluation of statistical and survey methods and indicators for use in natural or social science research projects, or in the planning of surveys and censuses or in the determination of statistical measures and techniques for data analysis and reporting;\n\nthe provision of advice in the fields of economics, sociology and statistics; and\n\nthe leadership of any of the above activities.\n\nPositions excluded from the Economics and Social Science Services Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance:\n\nthe operation, scheduling or controlling of the operations of electronic equipment used in the processing of data for the purpose of reporting, storing, extracting and comparing information or for solving formulated problems according to prescribed plans;\n\nthe collecting, recording, arranging, transmitting and processing of information, the filing and distribution of information holdings, and the direct application of rules and regulations;\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services or other activities directed to the public or to the Public Service;\n\nthe explanation, promotion and publication of federal government programs, policies and services;\n\nthe application of a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics to the development or application of mathematical and analytical methods, including those of mathematical statistics; and\n\nthe planning, development, delivery and management of economic development policies, programs, services and other activities designed to promote the establishment, growth and improvement of industry, commerce and export trade and the regulation of trade and commerce.\n\nThis element measures the latitude applied and the impact of decision making in EC work. The latitude required measures the scope to make decisions and the risks involved in reaching solutions or making decisions. The impact of decisions may range from the modification of work methods to the design of complex research and analytical studies, and from single issues to policy or program development and direction.

        "main_content": "Border Services group effective August 26, 2005\n\nBorder Services job evaluation standard effective August 26, 2005\n\nAddition of Amendments section\n\nInclusion of effective date of the standard in the Introduction section\n\nInsertion of Application Guidelines\n\nIntroduction\n\nRating Scale Summary\n\nPoint Boundaries\n\nBorder Services Group Definition\n\nElement 1 – Knowledge\n\nElement 2 – Analytical Skills\n\nElement 3 – Communication Skills\n\nElement 4 – Interaction\n\nElement 5 – People and Operational Management\n\nElement 6 – Decision Making\n\nElement 7 – Physical Effort\n\nElement 8 – Sensory Effort\n\nElement 9 – Risk to Health\n\nElement 10 – Work Environment\n\nAppendix A: Border Services Group (FB) - Application Guidelines\n\nThis standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Border Services (FB) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe job evaluation standard for the FB group is a point-rating  plan that includes an introduction, the definition of the  group, the rating scale and level point boundaries.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators.\n\nThe Border Services classification standard must be used in conjunction with the \"Application Guidelines\" document. This reference tool has been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the Border Services classification standard in order to appropriately and consistently evaluate Border Services work.\n\nTen elements are used in this job evaluation plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in FB jobs.\n\nThe importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements.\n\nEach element in the FB standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element.\n\nThe Border Services Group comprises positions in the Canada Border Services Agency that are primarily involved in the planning, development, delivery, or management of the inspection and control of people and goods entering Canada.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\ndetermining the admissibility of people or goods entering Canada;\n\npost-entry verification of people or goods that have entered Canada;\n\narresting, detaining or removing those people who may be in violation of Canada's laws;\n\ninvestigating the illegal entry of people or goods;\n\nconducting intelligence activities related to the monitoring, inspection or control of people or goods entering Canada;\n\ndeveloping Canada Border Services Agency operational directives to be followed in carrying out the above activities; and\n\nthe leadership of any of the above activities.\n\nPositions excluded from the Border Services Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance:\n\nthe collecting, recording, arranging, transmitting and processing of information, the filing and distribution of information holdings, and the direct application of rules and regulations; or\n\nthe planning, development, delivery or management of government policies, programs, services or other activities directed to the public other than those involving the inspection and control of people and goods entering Canada.\n\nThis element measures the level of technical or domain knowledge of job-related concepts, principles, practices, processes or approaches, as well as contextual knowledge including knowledge of people, organizations, external circumstances, legislation, regulations, etc., required to perform the job in an effective manner. Such knowledge can be acquired through experience within and outside the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nThe following is a description of the six degrees and the points allocated to each degree:\n\nRequires knowledge of the practices, procedures, and techniques related to own job and job area. The job consists of a well-defined range of work and responsibilities. Knowledge is applied to specific and practical work situations.\n\nRequires working knowledge of delivery activities within a defined program or service area and a basic understanding of the operational and legislative contexts relative to the specific program or service delivery area.

It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe classification standard for the FS group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, definition of the group and the rating scale.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators.\n\nEight elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in FS jobs.\n\nThe importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements.\n\nEach element in the FS standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element.\n\nThe Foreign Service Group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the planning, development, delivery and promotion of Canada's diplomatic, commercial, human rights, cultural, promotional, consular and international development policies and interests in other countries and in international organizations through the career rotational foreign service.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\ncommercial and economic relations and trade policy – the planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services or other activities directed at Canada's economic or trade relations with foreign countries, including the development, promotion or strengthening of Canada's economic or trade interests in bilateral or multilateral forums;\n\npolitical and economic relations – the planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services or other activities directed at Canada's political relationships with foreign countries;\n\nimmigration affairs – the delivery or management of immigration policies, programs, services or other activities in support of the Canadian immigration program abroad;\n\nlegal affairs – the provision of legal advice to the federal government on Canada's international rights and obligations; the interpretation and application of international legal obligations; the negotiation of various bilateral and multilateral agreements, treaties and conventions; and the defence of Canada's position respecting those obligations and agreements including dispute settlement;\n\ncommunications and culture – the planning, development, delivery or management of communications and cultural policies, programs and services abroad to promote Canada's foreign service role to Canadians and to promote Canada in the world;\n\nconsular affairs and emergency management – the planning, development, delivery or management of consular affairs or emergency services and programs abroad in support of Canadian and missions; and\n\nthe provision of related advice.\n\nPositions excluded from the Foreign Service Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those in which one or more of the following activities is/are of primary importance:\n\nthe provision of administrative or information services as described in the Program and Administrative Services Group; and\n\nthe representation in other countries of Canadian interests in a specialized field when the incumbent is not a career rotational foreign service officer.\n\nThis element measures the level of knowledge and business acumen required to perform the job in an effective manner.\n\nThis element captures both the knowledge of job related concepts such asrelevant area of expertise,international issues/area of application, principles, practices/processes or approaches, legislation and thepracticalknowledge acquired through experience in the international milieu.\n\nThe following is a description of the four degrees:\n\nRequires basic knowledge in a relevant area of expertise.

This element recognizes the increasing level of analytical skill that stems from factors such as the nature and complexity of the information, the medium, and the multiplicity and diversity of sources of information. Information includes both oral and written information. It refers to files, documents, knowledge of events and situations, and other data sources required to fulfill the job responsibilities.\n\nThe following is a description of the four degrees:\n\nGathers and analyzes information torespond to a specific need. The analysis of the information islimited to the area of responsibility.\n\nIndependently synthesises and analyses a variety of sources to identify gaps, determine missing information, or to identify the nature of other sources that should be examined.

It is a key  component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with  the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe IT job evaluation standard  is a point-rating plan consisting of the definition of the  group, introduction, overview of the job  evaluation standard, glossary of key terms, the notes to raters and element  rating scales, and benchmark job descriptions.\n\nSeven elements are used in this  plan. These elements represent aspects of work that are common to all jobs and  important in the capture of the overall nature and value of IT work at each  level, as well as serve to differentiate amongst the levels. These elements  also reflect coverage of the four broad pay equity factors of Skill, Effort,  Responsibility and Working Conditions required by prevailing legislation and  guidelines on Equal Wages.\n\nEach element contains a  definition and a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work  present in IT jobs and are designed to fairly, objectively and fully measure  the relative value of IT jobs in a gender-neutral fashion. The elements in the  IT job evaluation plan are as follows:\n\nCritical Thinking and Analysis  (Skill and Effort)\n\nLeadership and Planning  (Responsibility)\n\nTechnical Knowledge (Skill)\n\nManagement Knowledge (Skill)\n\nCommunication and Interaction  (Skill and Responsibility)\n\nEffort (Effort)Sensory EffortPhysical Effort\n\nSensory Effort\n\nPhysical Effort\n\nWork Environment (Working Conditions)Psychological Work EnvironmentPhysical Work Environment\n\nPsychological Work Environment\n\nPhysical Work Environment\n\nThe notes to raters describe how  the job evaluation plan works, guide interpretation, and facilitate accurate,  fair, and consistent application across the core public administration.\n\nBenchmarks are provided as  reference tools to exemplify the various levels of work found in the IT  Occupational Group. Each benchmark consists of a list of key activities and information  specific to the elements used in this job evaluation plan. These benchmarks are  an integral part of the job evaluation standard and provide examples of work at  the various element degrees.\n\nThis IT job evaluation plan must be used in  conjunction with the notes to raters and the benchmarks. There are five steps  in the application of this job evaluation standard:\n\nThe subject position job description is  studied, including all supporting organizational information, to ensure full  understanding of the work as a whole including work context. The relationship  of the subject position to other positions within the organization is  important.\n\nAllocation of the position to the occupational  group is decided by referring to the occupational group definition and  description of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees for each element are  determined by comparing the subject position with the degree descriptors in the  rating scales and referring to the notes to raters. The job description is  compared with the benchmarks illustrating the degree tentatively selected, and  comparisons are also made with the benchmarks for the degrees above and below  the degree tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the selection.\n\nThe point values for all elements are added to  determine the total point rating and resulting level.\n\nThe position being rated is compared, as a  whole, to a benchmark with a similar rating pattern and comparable total points  as a check on the validity of the level selected.\n\nThe IT Job Evaluation Standard is  designed around five levels of work, reflecting business, organization design,  work design and workforce management realities as described by key business and  functional leaders charged with the design and management of IT organizations  and work. While there are a variety of distinct technology disciplines and  areas of expertise within the IT Occupational Group, the broad workforce  structure looks as follows:\n\nThis figure  represents the roles of work within the IT job evaluation standard in relation  to the various classification levels.\n\nThere are three  roles that can exist: one is individual contributor role; another is  project manager role; and the third is functional manager role.\n\nJobs at IT-01 and  IT-02 are junior/developing level and working level and are uniquely individual  contributor role.\n\nJobs at IT-03 can  be Technical Advisor in the individual contributor role or Project Lead in the  project management role or Team Lead in the functional management role.\n\nJobs at IT-04 can  be Senior Advisor in the individual contributor role or Senior Project Manager  in the project management role or Manager in the functional management role.\n\nJobs at IT-05 are  uniquely Director in the in the functional management role.\n\nThis IT Job Evaluation Standard  is a point rating plan, meaning an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the relative value of jobs. The relative value of each element  measured in the job evaluation plan is mathematically expressed as a percentage  weight relative to all other elements in the plan – the sum of the weights of  all elements therefore equals 100%.

As per theDepartment of Justice Act, the Department supports the Attorney General of Canada who “shall advise the heads of departments of the Government on all matters of law connected with such departments” and “shall have the regulation and conduct all litigation for or against the Crown or any department, in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of Canada.”\n\nThese services include providing legal advice, preparing legal documents, drafting legislation, and regulating or conducting litigation for or against the Crown or any department. The Department of Justice assures overall consistency and integrity of legal services for the federal government. As such, the Department of Justice holds the exclusive authority to approve the provision of legal services, except for those organizations whose enabling legislation includes the authority to provide legal services or legal advice.\n\nAll organizations in the core public administration must consult the Department of Justice before creating any new LC positions.\n\nThe Law Management occupational group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of the law and its practice in the management of legal functions, with accountability for exercising delegated authority over human and financial resources.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for the following activities:\n\nproviding legal advice on the development, direction, conduct or management of programs or services; and\n\nmanaging legal programs or services and determining the nature and priority of objectives and resources committed to their achievement within and across organizations.\n\nPositions excluded from the Law Management occupational group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group.\n\nThis standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Law Management (LC) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe LC job evaluation standard is a point rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of the group, the rating scale and the point boundaries, the element characteristics associated with each level, the benchmark positions and the notes to raters.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical, quantitative method of determining the relative value of jobs. Point rating plans define characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the evaluators.\n\nSix elements are used in this evaluation plan. Each element is designed as a continuum of value that contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels at which the aspect of work is present in law management jobs.\n\nIn a point rating classification tool, each element is given a relative weight indicating its relative importance to the overall value of work for the target population. This weight translates into a range of points that can be granted under that element. Each element is subdivided into levels, or degrees, to each a specific point value is assigned, and is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The value of a given job using this system is measured by totaling the points corresponding to the degrees assigned within each element. The weights corresponding to the Law Management group evaluation plan are as follows:\n\nBenchmark position descriptionsare used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and the relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the element ratings.\n\nThere are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nAllocation of the position to the occupational group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the application guidelines.\n\nThe description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the element in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established.\n\nThe point values for all elements are added up to determine the total point rating.\n\nThe position being rated is compared as a whole to benchmark positions to which similar total point values have been assigned, as a check on the validity of the total rating.\n\nThe Law Management occupational groupapplication guidelineshave been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the LC job evaluation standard in order to accurately, fairly and consistently evaluate LC work. The application guidelines are a reference tool and must be used in conjunction with the LC job evaluation standard.\n\nIn case of a discrepancy between the job evaluation standard and the application guidelines in the appendix, the job evaluation standard will take precedence.\n\nThe application guidelines may be updated as required.\n\nThe distribution of points across each element in the Law Management evaluation plan is presented below in the point rating table.\n\nThe following table illustrates the minimum and maximum points for each level.\n\nThis element measures a combination of the level of subject-matter knowledge of the law and its practice, contextual knowledge of the legal, policy, operational and socio-political environments, as well as the levels of strategic and operational knowledge of management principles and their application required to perform at increasing levels of management in the organization. Increasing levels of knowledge are typically acquired through education and experience within and outside the organization.\n\nRequires an in-depth knowledge of a number of areas of law or practice particularly with respect to assigned areas of work including, knowledge of legal practices and processes and their application, clients' business, partners, and the legal and broader business environments within which the job operates.\n\nRequires sound knowledge of management principles, processes and approaches, and their application to a variety of operational challenges.\n\nRequires an in-depth and extensive knowledge of a broad field of law or practice, including a comprehensive understanding of legal practices and process, and their strategic application to the broader legal, government and non-government environments.\n\nRequires in-depth knowledge of business processes and operational management approaches within a program, policy or service development or delivery group and an in-depth understanding of the relevant legal, operational and policy contexts related to the broader functional area or business line.\n\nRequires an in-depth and extensive knowledge of a broad field of law or practice, the strategic application of the law to the broader legal, government and non-government environments, and linkages, alignment and impacts with other areas of law or broad business operations.\n\nRequires highly-developed knowledge of strategic and operational management approaches and the translation of strategic objectives into operational priorities and plans. Requires a highly-developed understanding of the various challenges and integration points for a complex multi-dimensional program or operation including an extensive understanding of the relevant legal, operational and policy contexts related to a broader legal portfolio a",

As per theDepartment of Justice Act, the Department supports the Attorney General of Canada who “shall advise the heads of departments of the Government on all matters of law connected with such departments” and “shall have the regulation and conduct all litigation for or against the Crown or any department, in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of Canada.”\n\nThese services include providing legal advice, preparing legal documents, drafting legislation, and regulating or conducting litigation for or against the Crown or any department. The Department of Justice assures overall consistency and integrity of legal services for the federal government. As such, the Department of Justice holds the exclusive authority to approve the provision of legal services, except for those organizations whose enabling legislation includes the authority to provide legal services or legal advice.\n\nAll organizations in the core public administration must consult with the Department of Justice before creating any new LP positions.\n\nThe Law Practitioner occupational group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of the law and its practice to the performance of legal functions.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nThe provision of legal advice and legal services;\n\nThe drafting of legislation, including regulations and Orders in Council;\n\nThe conduct of litigation and prosecution;\n\nThe provision of legal policy work and law reform work in the areas of responsibility of the Minister of Justice; and\n\nThe provision of legal research and legal editing services.\n\nPositions excluded from the Law Practitioner occupational group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group.\n\nAlso excluded are positions that require the interpretation of regulations; the drafting of contracts, leases or other legal documents; or the conduct of studies in which a comprehensive knowledge of law is desirable but not mandatory.\n\nThis standard is  to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Law  Practitioner (LP) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023.  It is a key component of the classification program  and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy  context.\n\nThe job evaluation standard for  the  LP  group is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, the definition of  the    group,  the rating scale, level point boundaries, element characteristics, benchmark  position descriptions, and applications guidelines.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating plans define  characteristics or elements common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees  of each element, and allocate point values to each degree. The total value  determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the  evaluators.\n\nSix elements are used in this plan. Each element contains a number of degrees that describe the various levels of work that may be present in law practitioner jobs.\n\nThe importance of the work characteristics in terms of assessing the relative value of each element is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the elements.\n\nEach element in the Law Practitioner group job evaluation standard is designed as a continuum of value, ranging from low to high. The overall value of a given job using this system is therefore the sum of the points for each selected rating in each element.\n\nBenchmark position descriptionsare used to exemplify degrees of each element and illustrate progression in the job evaluation standard, the application of the elements and the relationship between elements. Each description consists of a list of the principal duties and specifications describing the degree of each element to which the position is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point values assigned to each element are shown in the specifications. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the element ratings.\n\nThere are six steps in the application of this job evaluation standard.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nAllocation of the position to the occupational group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees of each element in the job being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the descriptions of elements and the application guidelines.\n\nThe description of the element in each of the benchmark positions exemplifying the degree tentatively established is compared with the description of the element in the position being rated. Comparisons are also made with descriptions of the element in benchmark positions for the degrees above and below the one tentatively established.\n\nThe point values for all elements are added up to determine the total point rating.\n\nThe position being rated is compared as a whole to benchmark positions to which similar total point values have been assigned, as a check on the validity of the total rating.\n\nThe Law Practitioner (LP) occupational groupapplication guidelineshave been developed to assist evaluators in understanding and applying the LP job evaluation standard in order to accurately, fairly and consistently evaluate LP work. The application guidelines are a reference tool and must be used in conjunction with the LP job evaluation standard.\n\nIn case of a discrepancy between the job evaluation standard and the application guidelines in the appendix, the job evaluation standard will take precedence.\n\nThe application guidelines may be updated as required.\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of points allocated to each element.\n\nThe following table illustrates the minimum and maximum points for each level.\n\nThe structure of the LP Classification Standard has been designed with the intention that level 2 encompasses the majority of the organizational work requirements.\n\nReturn to table note*referrer\n\nThis is a development level reserved for employees that are completing the articling program to develop the essential knowledge, skills and experience for practicing law. Work at this level will enable legal officers to qualify for membership in the law societies of one of the provinces or territories of Canada, including the Chambre des notaires du Québec.\n\nWork at this level is performed under the supervision of a principal (law manager or law practitioner), who is a member of the law societies of one of the Canadian provinces or territories. It involves the performance of a variety of duties such as: conducting legal research; writing legal memoranda and other communications; drafting legal documents; participating in the preparation and conduct of cases, negotiations or mediations, interviews or meetings; analyzing problems based on law and facts and recommending options for resolution; or any other activity required by the particular law society concerned.\n\nLP-00 is the designated group and level to be used to classify Articling Student positions.\n\nThis element captures the requirement for critical thinking and analysis in law practitioner work. This element measures the increasing level of critical thinking and analysis that stem from the nature and complexity of typical problems, issues, and files encountered in the work; the nature of analysis and judgment that must be applied; and the nature of the guidance available.\n\nProblems or issues are typically of limited scope, risk or impact with defined solution options. Critical thinking involves the identification of relevant facts and issues, research of legal issues, the identification of solution approaches and the production of a variety of legal products. Direction and oversight are provided by management or more senior counsel.\n\nBM 1BM 2BM 3\n\nProblems or issues represent a wide variety of more challenging legal issues and problems with a variety of broad-reaching impacts on other areas of law, policy, process, clients or business results. Critical thinking involves questioning and reframing problem definitions and assumptions to uncover and address underlying issues, including balancing client requirements with legal intent and governme",

It is a key component of the classification program and must  be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThis standard describes the  point rating plan to be used to evaluate jobs allocated to  the WP classification of the PA Group. It consists of an  introduction, general definitions, and point rating scales.  The BM position descriptions are  in Part II.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical,  quantitative method of determining the relative value of jobs. It is  particularly suited to heterogeneous occupational groups in which jobs consist  of varied combinations of tasks. Essentially, point rating plans define  characteristics or factors common to the jobs being evaluated.\n\nThey define  degrees of each factor and allocate point values to each degree. The total  value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the  raters.\n\nAll methods of job evaluation require the exercise of  judgment and the orderly collection and analysis of information so that  consistent judgments can be made. The point rating method facilitates rational  discussion and resolution of differences in determining the relative worth of  jobs.\n\nThe Welfare Programs (WP) classification of theProgram and Administrative Services (PA)group comprises positions that are  primarily involved in the planning, development, delivery or management of administrative and federal government policies, programs, services or other activities directed to the public.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nInclusion 12 of thePAGroup – the planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services or other activities dealing with the social development, settlement, adjustment and rehabilitation of groups, communities or individuals including the planning, development and delivery of welfare services; and\n\nInclusion 15 of thePAGroup – the leadership of any of the above-mentioned activities.\n\nPositions excluded from thePAGroup are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group.\n\nThis standard describes the point rating plan to be used to evaluate jobs allocated to theWPclassification of thePAGroup.

These are the principal sources of reference when allocating positions to the classification.\n\nConsistent with these statements are the following descriptions of work assignments normally associated withWP. They are intended as a further aid to raters in determining the allocation of positions to the classification.\n\nSocial Development Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application or supervision of programs to guide, advise, stimulate and encourage the social, political, cultural and economic development of Aboriginal people living within defined geographic boundaries and individuals.\n\nSocial Development Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application or supervision of programs to guide, advise, stimulate and encourage the social, political, cultural and economic development of Aboriginal people living within defined geographic boundaries and individuals.\n\nVeterans’ Welfare Services Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application, supervision and administration of a program to provide such services as social adjustment, rehabilitation, counselling, welfare or financial benefit services to meet the needs of veterans and their families.\n\nVeterans’ Welfare Services Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application, supervision and administration of a program to provide such services as social adjustment, rehabilitation, counselling, welfare or financial benefit services to meet the needs of veterans and their families.\n\nEmergency Welfare Services Assignmentsare concerned with the planning and coordination of emergency services where adequate services are not otherwise provided and with training programs and formulation of plans with foreign, provincial and municipal governments for an emergency service including clothing, lodging, registration and enquiry services.\n\nEmergency Welfare Services Assignmentsare concerned with the planning and coordination of emergency services where adequate services are not otherwise provided and with training programs and formulation of plans with foreign, provincial and municipal governments for an emergency service including clothing, lodging, registration and enquiry services.\n\nCorrectional Services Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application and administration of programs in the parole and penitentiaries services, which include the counselling and guidance of parolees and inmates, analysis and evaluation of their rehabilitation and training needs, professional diagnostic and reporting services and the development and implementation of corrective and follow-up programs.\n\nCorrectional Services Assignmentsare concerned with the development, application and administration of programs in the parole and penitentiaries services, which include the counselling and guidance of parolees and inmates, analysis and evaluation of their rehabilitation and training needs, professional diagnostic and reporting services and the development and implementation of corrective and follow-up programs.\n\nThe combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs. They deal only with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished and that are useful in determining the relative value of jobs.\n\nFour factors are used in this plan. All the factors have more than one dimension and have been defined in terms of two or three related elements. The factors and elements are:\n\nKnowledgeEducationExperienceContinuing Study\n\nEducation\n\nExperience\n\nContinuing Study\n\nProblem SolvingScope for Problem SolvingImpact of Activities\n\nScope for Problem Solving\n\nImpact of Activities\n\nResponsibility for ContactsNature of ContactsPersons Contacted\n\nNature of Contacts\n\nPersons Contacted\n\nSupervisionLevel of Employees SupervisedNumbers Supervised\n\nLevel of Employees Supervised\n\nNumbers Supervised\n\nThe maximum point value assigned to each factor reflects its relative importance. Similarly, point values have been assigned to the degrees of the factors.\n\nPoint values increase arithmetically as the degrees of the factor increase. The minimum point values for knowledge, problem solving and responsibility for contacts are one-fifth of the maximum value. The minimum value for supervision is one-tenth of the maximum value, although there will be positions where this factor does not apply. The ranges of point values are:\n\nKnowledge\n\nEducation and Experience\n\n60\n\n300\n\nContinuing Study\n\n10\n\n50\n\nProblem Solving\n\n70\n\n350\n\nResponsibility for Contacts\n\n30\n\n150\n\nSupervision\n\nN/A\n\n150\n\nTotal\n\n170\n\n1,000\n\nBMposition descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of each factor or element.

        "main_content": "Group definition effective May 15, 2014.\n\nJob evaluation standard effective May 15, 2024.\n\nRemoval of Policy Context section.\n\nInclusion of effective date of standard in the Introduction section.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolice Operations Support Group Definition\n\nTelecommunications Operations (PO-TCO) Sub-Group\n\nIntercept Monitoring and Analysis (PO-IMA) Sub-Group\n\nThis standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level for work allocated to the Police Operations Support (PO) occupational group, effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe PO group is comprised of two subgroups: the Telecommunications Operations and the Intercept Monitoring and Analysis, each with its own job evaluation plan.\n\nThe present document contains the two evaluation plans used to establish the relative value of jobs allocated to the PO group.\n\nFor ease of reference, this document is divided into various sections. The first few sections contain general information such as overall PO group definition. The subsequent sections deal with the two subgroups separately. Specifically, for each subgroup, there are sections containing the subgroup definition, a glossary, notes to raters, a level progression chart and benchmark position descriptions.\n\nFour factors are used in this plan and their respective elements are listed below.\n\nThe combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs. Selected factors and elements deal with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished and that are useful in determining the relative value of jobs.\n\nSkillsKnowledge and Skills\n\nKnowledge and Skills\n\nEffortPhysical EffortIntellectual Effort\n\nPhysical Effort\n\nIntellectual Effort\n\nResponsibilityTechnical ResponsibilitiesHuman Resource and Financial Responsibilities\n\nTechnical Responsibilities\n\nHuman Resource and Financial Responsibilities\n\nWorking ConditionsPhysical EnvironmentPsychological Environment\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nPsychological Environment\n\nBenchmark position descriptions are used to exemplify the various levels of work found in each sub-group. Each description consists of a list of key activities and specifications providing information pertaining to the factors and elements used in the evaluation plan. The benchmark position descriptions have been evaluated and the level assigned is clearly identified. These benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the evaluation plan and are used to ensure consistency in application of the level progression chart.\n\nAllocation of the position to the group is confirmed by reference to the intent of the occupational group and sub-group definitions and the review of their respective inclusions and exclusions.\n\nThere are three steps in the application of this classification standard.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being evaluated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied;\n\nThe position is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of the position against the level progression chart and determining which level best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position; and\n\nThe position description being evaluated is compared with the benchmark position descriptions illustrating the level tentatively selected, and comparisons are also made with the benchmark position descriptions for the levels above and below the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level selected.\n\nThe Police Operations Support Group comprises positions that are primarily engaged in planning, developing, conducting or managing telecommunications in support of police operations.\n\nThe Police Operations Support Group includes only those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nplanning, developing, conducting or managing telecommunications operations in support of police operations;\n\nplanning, developing, conducting or managing lawfully authorized telecommunications interceptions in support of police operations.\n\nPositions excluded from the Police Operations Support Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other occupational group, and for more certainty, those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance:\n\noperation, routine servicing and minor repair of a variety of cryptographic, facsimile, electronic mail and associated communications equipment in preparing, receiving, transmitting, and relaying messages; and the performance of related activities including recording receipt and dispatch times of traffic, priority allocation and distribution of message copies that require special knowledge of communication procedures, format, schedules, message traffic routes and equipment operation;\n\noperation of electronic equipment to communicate information for the safety of life at sea, the protection of the environment and the efficient movement of marine vessels, and to monitor radio aids to marine navigation, and the provision of associated advisory services;\n\nmaintenance and repair of electronic and associated electro-mechanical or electrical equipment.\n\nThe Telecommunications Operations Sub-Group comprises positions that are primarily engaged in planning, developing, conducting or managing telecommunications operations in support of police operations.\n\nThe Telecommunications Operations Sub-Group includes only those positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\noperating, controlling and monitoring police telecommunications systems to respond to public requests for assistance; inputting, retrieving and disseminating information from information management systems; and providing dispatch service and information to support police operations;\n\nanalyzing, modifying or developing policies, operating methods or procedures in support of telecommunications operations;\n\ndeveloping or delivering training on operating methods or procedures or the use of specialized equipment for telecommunications operations;\n\nprocessing protected and non-protected information via electronic systems to and from local, national and international locations;\n\nsupervising or managing any of the above activities.\n\nItems listed in the level progression chart are generally cumulative from one level to the next.\n\nIt is important to consider the general description given for each level at the top of the chart. These descriptions set the context and level of autonomy within which the responsibilities are performed.\n\nWhile speed and accuracy associated to typing skills constitute a PO-TCO position requirement, these skills are evaluated as part of the staffing process for entry level.\n\nKnowledge of supervision and management techniques include knowledge of departmental HR policies and procedures, conflict resolution skills, etc.\n\nNo specific notes.\n\nNo specific notes.\n\nThis element refers to the demands placed on employees and the effects of the demands in terms of mental and physical energy required by the job.\n\nPhysical effort is measured in terms of the working position and its duration.\n\nIntellectual effort is measured by the frequency or duration of the following work requirements: visual and auditory concentration and versatility of tasks.\n\nThis element refers to the conditions under which employees are required to perform their work and addresses both physical and psychological aspects of the job.\n\nThe physical environment is defined by the frequency and percentage of time spent in specific work space, such as in the communication centre per se or in closed-in office space.\n\nWork space in communication centres may be confined, restrictive or shared with other employees. It is also characterized by constant background noise from equipment, voices, interruptions, bells, buzzers, etc.\n\nThe level progression chart refers to \"administrative\" work and \"office\" work. Administrative work refers to work performed at one's station, typically located in a communication centre environment, while not on phone duties. Office work refers to work performed in a closed-in office located adjacent to the communication centre, allowing managers to be constantly aware of the pulse of activities in the communication centre and ready to intervene as required. Office work also refers to work performed in other office settings, such as those in headquarters.\n\nThe psychological environment captures aspects of the work such as the work schedule as well as frequency of having to deal with stressful/unpleasant interpersonal contacts and with unpredictable situations.\n\nKnowledge/skills includemostof the following:\n\nbasic knowledge and skills to use telecommunications equipment and police information systems\n\nknowledge of operational communication centre (OCC) or National Operations Centre (NOC) call taking protocols and communication techniques\n\nknowledge of common offences under theCriminal Code, Provincial and Federal Statutes, and differences between criminal and civil matters\n\nknowledge of community characteristics (geographic knowledge – highway, counties, boundaries for detachments, etc., community culture, municipal, provincial and federal agencies, etc.)\n\nbasic knowledge of internal administrative and operational policies and standard operating procedures for operational communication centres or national operations centres\n\nResponsibilities includeone or moreof the following:\n\nprocessing classified and unclassified messages and document traffic\n\nprocessing routine computer entries through police systems (e.g. file maintenance transactions, facility intrusion/false alarms, etc.)\n\nmonitoring video surveillance (e.g. detachments/sites or silent alarms, etc.)\n\nperforming radio dispatching ",

This new name should be reflected in all future documents referring to this group and is consistent with the nature of the work of the majority of employees in the group. Classification standards, codes and other documents will not be changed at this time, but will change gradually as the Classification Simplification project is implemented.\n\nAssistant SecretaryClassification, Equal Pay, and Pay Administration Division\n\nIntroduction\n\nGroup Definition\n\nAdvisory Sub-groupSub-group DefinitionLevel Descriptions\n\nSub-group Definition\n\nLevel Descriptions\n\nDietitian Sub-groupSub-group DefinitionLevel Descriptions\n\nSub-group Definition\n\nLevel Descriptions\n\nHome Economist Sub-groupSub-group DefinitionLevel Descriptions\n\nSub-group Definition\n\nLevel Descriptions\n\nBenchmark Position Description Index\n\nThis standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level of work  allocated to the Health Services (SH) occupational group evaluated using the Nutrition  and Dietetics (ND) job evaluation standard effective October 6, 2023. It is  a key component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction  with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe ND job evaluation standard  describes the evaluation plan to be used to determine the level of jobs  allocated to the Nutrition and Dietetics classification of the SH group,  comprising the Advisory, Dietitian and Home Economist subgroups. It consists of  an introduction and definitions of  the classification  and the three subgroups. The standard also includes level descriptions and  benchmark position descriptions for each subgroup.\n\nThe level description method of  job evaluation is used to classify jobs allocated to the subgroups. The levels  in the classification plan for each subgroup are described in terms of the  primary features to be considered in assigning jobs to a level. Jobs are  regarded as being of equal value when they best correspond, on the whole, with  the description of a level and the benchmark position description exemplifying  that level.\n\nBenchmark position descriptions exemplify each level. Each description consists of a summary and an explanation of the distinguishing features of the position. The benchmark position descriptions are an integral part of the three plans and are to be used to ensure consistency in applying the level descriptions.\n\nFour steps are to be followed in applying this classification standard:\n\nThe allocation of the position to the category, group and sub-group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position within the organizational setting is also studied.\n\nThe position is tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of the position with the level descriptions of the appropriate sub-group. The position is tentatively assigned to the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nThe description of the position being evaluated is compared with the benchmark position description illustrating the level tentatively selected, and comparisons are made with the benchmark position descriptions illustrating the levels above and below the level tentatively selected, as a check on the validity of the level selected.\n\nThe Nutrition and Dietetics (ND) classification within theHealth Services (SH) Groupcomprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the fields of nutrition and dietetics to the physical well-being of people.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nInclusion 9 of theSHGroup – the development of standards and guides in the field of nutrition and dietetics;

It is a key  component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with  the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThis standard describes the plan  used to evaluate positions allocated to the NU classification of the SH group.  It consists of an introduction,  and definitions  of the NU classification and the Hospital Nursing, Community Health Nursing,  and Medical Adjudicator Nursing subgroups.\n\nThe ultimate objective of job evaluation is the  determination of the relative value of jobs in each occupational group. In  2010, the Medical Adjudicator subgroup was added to the NU job evaluation  standard.\n\nA classification plan  of eight levels representing significant differences in the difficulty of the work  has been established for these sub-groups. Jobs assigned to a given level are  regarded as being of equivalent difficulty.\n\nUsing a level description, a developmental level at level one  has been established in the Hospital Nursing Sub-group and the Community Health  Nursing Sub-group to accommodate the positions where the work is carried out  under guidance of a senior nurse and from which, subsequently, incumbents are  usually appointed to an operating level.\n\nThe evaluation of positions at levels 2 to 8 and their  assignment to a classification level will be determined by the application of  three factors:\n\nProfessional Complexity and Responsibility;\n\nResponsibility for Management and Management Advisory Service;\n\nImpact.\n\nEach factor is described, and the descriptions designate the  features of the work assigned to positions allocated to the sub-groups. A list  of characteristics is included for each factor. The characteristics indicate  the features of the work that are to be considered when evaluating a position  under a particular factor. The factor characteristics serve to ensure that  consideration is given to all features of the work of a position.\n\nBenchmark position descriptions exemplify degrees 2 to 8 of each  factor and levels 2 to 8 of the classification plan. Each benchmark consists of  a descriptive title, a statement of the principal duties and a set of  specifications describing the features of the work of the position in terms of  the characteristics of each of the three factors. The specifications exemplify  the application of the evaluation plan to the duties and responsibilities of  the benchmark position and indicate the degree assigned to the position for  each factor. A classification level is assigned to each benchmark position.\n\nThere are six steps in the application of the classification  standard for these two sub-groups:\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the characteristics of each factor. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the characteristics of each factor.

The features of the work of the position being evaluated should be related to the degree highlight as a whole in its total context, not to isolated words or phrases.\n\nA degree under each factor is tentatively assigned to the position being evaluated by considering the duties and responsibilities of the position in relation to the range described for each factor characteristic and the degree highlights for the factor; and determining that the difficulty of work is equivalent to or greater or less than a degree that is described.

When one degree does not predominate, evaluators are to compare the total job with the benchmark position descriptions and determine the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nThe level of the position is determined by the degree that has been assigned to the position for at least two of the three factors. When one degree does not predominate, evaluators are to compare the total job with the benchmark position descriptions and determine the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and responsibilities of the position.\n\nThe position is compared with benchmark position  descriptions that have been assigned to the same level, as a check on the  validity of the level selected.\n\nThe position is compared with benchmark position  descriptions that have been assigned to the same level, as a check on the  validity of the level selected.\n\nA classification plan of two levels  representing significant differences in the difficulty of the work has been  established for this sub-group. Jobs assigned to a given level are regarded as  being of equivalent difficulty.\n\nExample of Work Activities demonstrates  levels 1 and 2 of the Medical Adjudicator classification plan. Each Example of  Work Activities consists of the principal duties and work performed for the  level described. A classification level is assigned to each Example of Work  Activities.\n\nThere are five steps in the application of  this classification standard to this sub-group.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the Example of Work Activities. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the Example of Work Activities.

        "main_content": "Category definition rescinded.\n\nNew occupational group definition map  established with new occupational group definitions linked to corresponding job  evaluation standards; in this case, the parts of the Health Services (SH) occupational  group evaluated using the Psychology (PS) job evaluation standard.\n\nAmendments to modernize and update terminology.\n\nRemoval of Policy Context section.\n\nInclusion  of effective date of standard in the Introduction section.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGroup Definition\n\nPsychology FactorsTechnical ComplexityProfessional ResponsibilityManagement Responsibility\n\nTechnical Complexity\n\nProfessional Responsibility\n\nManagement Responsibility\n\nBenchmark Position Description Index in Rating Order\n\nBenchmark Position Description Index in Alphabetical Order\n\nThis  standard is to be used to establish the appropriate level of work allocated to  the Health Services (SH) occupational group evaluated using the Psychology (PS)  job evaluation standard effective October 6, 2023. It is a key component of  the classification program and must be read in conjunction with the program’s  legislative and policy context.\n\nThis standard describes the plan  to be used to classify positions allocated to the PS classification of the SH  group. It consists of an introduction, definitions of the classification,  factor definitions and characteristics, rating scales and benchmark position  descriptions.\n\nA five-level classification plan  has been established for this occupational group. These levels represent  significant differences in the difficulty of the work.\n\nThe evaluation of positions and  their assignment to a classification level will be determined by the application  of three factors:\n\nTechnical complexity\n\nProfessional responsibility\n\nManagement responsibility\n\nThe factors selected deal with  most features of the work assigned to positions in the PS classification of the  SH group. A definition and a list of factor characteristics have been included  for each factor. The characteristics indicate the features of the work that are  to be considered when evaluating a position under a particular factor. Each  characteristic describes the lowest and the highest requirement. The factor  characteristics serve to ensure that consideration is given to all features of  the work of a position.\n\nBecause of the nature and  diversity of positions in PS classification of the SH group, it was not  considered possible to produce meaningful definitions for all degrees of the  factors that would demonstrate the increasing complexity of the work from the  lowest to the highest degree. As a result, degree definitions have been  included for the second and fourth degrees only. These degree definitions  highlight the features of the work that will be found in most positions at  these degrees. The degrees of each factor are illustrated by one or more  benchmark position descriptions.\n\nThe level of a position is determined by the degree assigned for at least two of the three factors. When one degree does not predominate, raters are to compare the total job with benchmark position descriptions and determine the level by ranking the position against appropriate benchmarks.\n\nThe ultimate objective of job evaluation is the determination of the relative values of jobs in each occupational group. Jobs assigned to a given level in an occupational group are regarded as being of equal difficulty.\n\nBenchmark position descriptions exemplify the degrees of each factor and the levels of the classification structure. Each benchmark consists of a descriptive title, a brief summary, a statement of the principal duties with the percentage of time devoted to each, and a set of specifications. The specifications describe the features of the work of the position in terms of the characteristics of each of the three factors and indicate the degree assigned to the position for each factor.\n\nThe specifications exemplify the application of the evaluation plan to the duties and responsibilities of the benchmark position. A classification level is assigned to each benchmark position.\n\nThere are five steps in the application of this classification standard.\n\nAllocation of the position to the category and group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole and of the nature of the duties and responsibilities as they relate to the characteristics of each factor. The relationship of the position being studied to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nA degree of each factor is tentatively assigned to the position being evaluated by considering the factor characteristics identified in the duties of the position and comparing them with the degree definitions. Degrees are assigned for each factor by determining that the characteristics of the position are equal to, more than, or less than a degree that is defined.\n\nThe degree tentatively selected is confirmed by comparison with the benchmark position descriptions.\n\nThe final rating of the position is determined by the degree that has been assigned to the position for at least two of the three factors.\n\nThe position is compared with benchmark position descriptions that have been assigned to the same level, as a check on the validity of the level selected.\n\nThe Psychology (PS) classification of theHealth Services (SH) Groupcomprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the field of psychology to the physical and mental well-being of people.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nInclusion 14 of the SH group – the conduct of research in human behaviour, the assessment of human motives, abilities, skills, decisions and acts, and the treatment of human behaviour;\n\nInclusion 17 of the SH group – the provision of advice in the above fields; and\n\nInclusion 18 of the SH group – the leadership of any of the above activities.\n\nPositions excluded from the Psychology (PS) classification of the Health Services (SH) Group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group.\n\nAlso excluded are positions that:\n\nExclusion 1 of the SH group – do not require the application of a comprehensive knowledge of psychology.\n\nThis factor is used to measure the difficulty of the work in terms of the use of approaches, methods and techniques; the interrelationships and the subtlety of variable factors that must be taken into account; and the required knowledge of the discipline, associated disciplines or functions, and departmental policy.\n\nWhen evaluating positions under this factor, raters are to consider the following characteristics:\n\nThe use of approaches, methods and techniques will range\n\nfrom applying, with some adaptation, established methods and techniques to meet the requirements of the work,\n\nto developing and applying new approaches, methods and techniques to meet the changing requirements of a program.\n\nThe interrelationships and subtlety of variable factors to be taken into account will range\n\nfrom work that involves a number of variable factors with straightforward interrelationships,\n\nto work that involves a large number of subtle interacting variables difficult to define and quantify.\n\nThe required knowledge of the discipline, associated disciplines or functions and departmental policy will range\n\nfrom a good knowledge of the theory, principles and techniques of a psychological specialty, with a specific knowledge of a particular aspect of the specialty, and knowledge of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines or functions,\n\nto an authoritative knowledge of the discipline and a comprehensive knowledge of the operations and requirements of associated disciplines and functions and of regulations and policies governing the department or government program.\n\nThis factor is used to measure the difficulty of the work in terms of the nature of the controls exercised over the work, the responsibility for making interpretations, decisions and recommendations, giving training in psychological principles and techniques, and providing advice.\n\nWhen evaluating positions under this factor, raters are to consider the following characteristics:\n\nThe guidance available will range\n\nfrom direction on the development of new techniques and advice on unusual problems and likely approaches,\n\nto general direction concerning policy intent and program objectives.\n\nThe extent to which work is checked will range\n\nfrom review of work plans and assessment of results,\n\nto evaluation of the work in terms of the effectiveness of the psychological program.\n\nResponsibility for making interpretations, decisions and recommendations will range\n\nfrom ensuring that own work is accurate and meaningful, and making recommendations based on the interpretation of findings,\n\nto analyzing and interpreting a large amount of complex information and making decisions and recommendations regarding the studies and services to be carried out and the criteria to be followed to achieve the objectives of a psychological program.\n\nResponsibility for giving training in psychological principles and techniques will range\n\nfrom giving lectures and/or demonstrations to non-psychological staff such as nurses, medical interns and residents, and technical staff,\n\nto evaluating training needs and determining the nature and content of the training required by professional and non-professional staff.\n\nResponsibility for providing psychological advice will range\n\nfrom providing guidance and advice to technical staff and employees in associated functions,\n\nto providing final, authoritative professional opinions and advice to other professionals and senior off",

It is a key  component of the classification program and must be read in conjunction with  the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe SW classification of the SH group contains  two sub-groups.\n\nThe Chaplain (CHA) sub-group  includes chaplain positions in hospitals and correctional institutions and  staff advisors. The level description method of job evaluation is used to  evaluate positions allocated to this sub-group.\n\nThe Social Work (SCW) sub-group  includes caseworker, supervisor, advisor, and administrator positions in the  social work field. The point-rating method of job evaluation is used to  evaluate positions allocated to this sub-group.\n\nThe Social  Work (SW) classification of theHealth Services (SH) Groupcomprises positions that are  primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of  professional specialties in the field of social work to the physical and mental  well-being of people.\n\nNotwithstanding  the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions  that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the  following activities:\n\nInclusion  15 of the SH Group – the promotion of individual, group and community well-being  through the identification and assessment of social needs; and the planning,  development and delivery and management of social programs and social work  services with the objective of lessening, removing or preventing the physical,  emotional and material problems of individuals, families or groups;\n\nInclusion  17 of the SH Group – the provision of advice in the above fields; and\n\nInclusion  18 of the SH Group – the leadership of any of the above activities.\n\nPositions excluded from the Health Services Group are those  whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those  in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance:\n\nExclusion 3 of the SH group – the  planning, development, delivery or management of policies, programs, services  or other activities dealing with the social development, settlement, adjustment  and rehabilitation of groups, communities or individuals, including the  planning, development and delivery of welfare services.\n\nAlso excluded are positions that:\n\nExclusion 1 of the SH Group – do not  require the application of a comprehensive knowledge of social work.\n\nThis standard describes the classification plan used to  determine the relative difficulty of jobs allocated to the Chaplain Sub-group.  It consists of an introduction, definitions of the Sub-group and level  descriptions.\n\nThe level description method is used to classify jobs  allocated to the Chaplain Sub-group. Each of the levels in the classification  plan is described in terms of the primary features used to assign Jobs to the  level. Jobs are regarded as being of equal difficulty and are assigned to the  same level when the duties and responsibilities best correspond, on the whole,  with the description of that level.\n\nThree steps are to be followed in applying this  classification standard.\n\nThe position description  is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of  the position being evaluated to positions above and below it in the  organization is also studied.\n\nThe  allocation of the position to the category and group is confirmed by reference  to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nThe position is  tentatively assigned to a level by comparing the duties and responsibilities of  the position with the level descriptions. The position is tentatively assigned  to the level that best corresponds on the whole with the duties and  responsibilities of the position.\n\nThe identification and assessment of individual and group  religious and spiritual needs; the provision of advice and counselling service  to patients and inmates. The conducting of divine services and religious  exercises; the provision of spiritual consolidation to hospital patients; the organization  of inmate programs in collaboration with the social development staff and members  of outside communities; the provision of religious education to patients,  inmates and staff; the arranging for material assistance for patients and  inmates during periods of adjustment and rehabilitation; the provision of  training and assessment programs directed towards the development of clinical  pastoral education; the planning, organizing and coordination of chaplaincy  activities on regional and national bases.\n\nPositions included in the sub-group are those that  involve the performance of chaplaincy duties.\n\nThis level includes those positions whose duties include  the conducting of divine services and religious exercises for, and providing  pastoral counselling to hospital patients. In addition, the work requires the  provision of advice and assistance to the patients’ families.\n\nThis level includes positions whose duties include the  provision or the coordination of pastoral counselling and assistance to inmates  and their families and to the staff of the institutions; the implementation of  religious rehabilitation programs; the communicating of offender needs to the  community and of the role of the institution and the public in helping inmates  re-enter the community.\n\nThis level includes positions whose duties include the  regional coordination of spiritual programs and activities; the provision of  consultation, administration, pastoral planning and liaison services; the  integration of chaplaincy services between the institution and the community;  the development and coordination of religious programs and the monitoring of  the needs of the inmate populations; the assessing of training needs and the  facilitation of training programs for the region; the representation of the  chaplaincy service at conferences, seminars, etc.\n\nThe classification standard  for the Social Welfare Sub-group is a point rating plan consisting of an  introduction, definition of the sub-group, rating scales and benchmark position  descriptions.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical, quantitative method of  determining the relative values of jobs. Point rating plans define  characteristics of factors common to the jobs being evaluated, define degrees  of each factor and allocate point values to each degree. The total value  determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by the raters.\n\nAll methods of job evaluation require the exercise of  judgment and the orderly collection and analysis of information in order that  consistent judgments can be made. The point rating method facilitates rational  discussion and resolution of differences in determining the relative values of  jobs.\n\nThe combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs.  They deal only with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished  and that are useful in determining the relative worth of jobs.\n\nThree factors are used in this plan. One of the factors  is two-dimensional and has been defined in terms of two related elements.\n\nThe  weighting of each factor reflects its relative importance. Similarly, points  are distributed to the factors or elements in an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the  rating plan the following factors, factor, weights and point values are used.\n\nBenchmark position  descriptions are used to exemplify degrees of factors. Each description consists  of a list of the principal duties with the percentage of time devoted to each,  and specifications describing the degree of each factor to which the position  is rated. The benchmark positions have been evaluated, and the degree and point  values assigned for each factor are shown in the specifications.\n\nThe rating scales  identify the Benchmark position descriptions that exemplify each degree. These  descriptions are an integral part of the point rating plan and are used to  ensure consistency in applying the rating scales.\n\nThere are  six steps in the application of this classification standard.\n\nThe position description is studied to ensure  understanding of the position as a whole. The relation of the position being  rated to the positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nAllocation of the  position to the category, group and sub-group is confirmed by reference to the  definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees of each  factor in the position being rated are determined by comparison w",

It is a key component of the classification program and must  be read in conjunction with the program’s legislative and policy context.\n\nThe MT job evaluation  standard is a point-rating plan consisting of an introduction, definition of  the MT classification of the SC-SCI subgroup, rating scales and illustrative  position descriptions.\n\nPoint rating is an analytical,  quantitative method of determining the relative values of jobs. Point-rating  plans define characteristics or factors common to the jobs being evaluated,  define degrees of each factor, and allocate point values to each degree. The  total value determined for each job is the sum of the point values assigned by  the raters.\n\nAll methods of job evaluation  require the exercise of judgement and the orderly collection and analysis of  information in order that consistent judgements can be made. The point-rating  method facilitates rational discussion and resolution of differences in  determining the relative values of jobs.\n\nFour factors are used in this plan, each of the factors having two elements. The factors and elements do not necessarily describe all aspects of the positions; they deal only with those characteristics that are useful in measuring and determining the relative value of positions. Each of the elements is divided into degrees. Each degree description indicates a level of work difficulty in respect to the characteristics of the element, and successive degrees represent significant escalations into the scale of relative work difficulty.\n\nThe importance of the characteristics of work in terms of assessing relative difficulty is reflected in the maximum point values assigned to the factors and elements.\n\nThe points assigned to the degree coordinates of the factors and elements increase in geometric progression from the minimum to maximum point value.\n\nDepth of knowledge\n\nBreadth of practical application\n\nComplexity\n\nImpact on end results\n\nSupervisory/managerial responsibility\n\nFreedom to act\n\nOral and/or written communications\n\nHuman relations skills\n\nThis standard does not contain benchmark positions in the traditional sense. However, in order to exemplify the degree coordinates of the two elements in any one of the four factors, illustrative position descriptions (IPDs) containing descriptive examples of the various degree coordinates have been provided. These illustrative position descriptions have been carefully selected to represent, within practical limitations, the full range of meteorological positions.\n\nThese illustrative position descriptions, with their descriptive examples of factor degree coordinates, are an integral part of the classification plan and should be used to ensure consistency in the application of the rating scales. The descriptive examples are part of \"live\" position descriptions and, as such, will be updated and replaced as necessary.\n\nThere are six steps in the application of this classification standard.\n\nOne of the important steps in the application of this standard is to ensure that the information being used to evaluate a given position is complete. It must include reference to the specific characteristics of work described in the factors as they relate to the duties of the position. The position description is studied to ensure understanding of the position as a whole, and of each factor. The relation of the position being rated to positions above and below it in the organization is also studied.\n\nAllocation for the position to the category and the group is confirmed by reference to the definitions and the descriptions of inclusions and exclusions.\n\nTentative degrees of each factor in the position being rated are determined by comparison with degree definitions in the rating scales. Uniform application of degree definitions requires frequent reference to the Factor Definitions, the Notes to Raters and to the Descriptive Examples of Element Degree contained in the illustrative position descriptions.\n\nThe description of the factor degree coordinate in any one of the descriptive examples exemplifying the degree tentatively established, is compared with the factor statement in the position being rated and also with descriptive examples having degrees above an below the one tentatively established.\n\nThe point values for all factors are added to determine the tentative total point rating.\n\nAs a check on the validity of the total rating, the position being rated is compared as a whole with positions to which similar total point values have been assigned.\n\nThe ultimate objective of job evaluation is to determine the relative value of jobs in each occupational group in order that employees carrying out the jobs may be paid at rates consistent with the relationship indicated. Jobs that fall within a designated range of point values will be regarded as of equal difficulty and value and will be allocated to the same level.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 11.1(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act, the Treasury Board of Canada hereby provides notice that the definition of the Applied Science and Engineering Group, effective March 18, 1999, as published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on March 27, 1999, is amended and replaced by the following definition that shall apply to the Applied Science and Patent Examination (SP) Group as well as the Applied Science (SP-SCI) and Patent Examination (SP-PEB) Sub-groups, effective May 16, 2005.\n\nThe Meteorology classification of theApplied Science and Patent Examination Group, Applied Science Sub-groupcomprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of comprehensive scientific and professional knowledge to one of the applied science programs involving the following: meteorology.\n\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, for greater certainty, it includes positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for one or more of the following activities:\n\nthe analysis and forecasting of weather and climatic phenomena; the development of instruments, methods and standards for observing and recording atmospheric phenomena; and the development, application and provision of data, information and advice in the application of meteorology to the economic and environmental problems of the country;\n\nthe planning and conduct of studies, the evaluation and interpretation of information and scientific research papers, reports, contracts or agreements, and the provision of advice in the above programs;\n\nthe planning, co-ordination and management of technology transfer in any of the above activities; and\n\nthe leadership of any of the above activities.\n\nPositions included in the Applied Science Sub-group may also be engaged, in part, in research in one of the programs involving the following: meteorology.\n\nPositions excluded from the Applied Science Sub-group are those whose primary purpose is included in the definition of any other group or those in which one or more of the following activities is of primary importance:\n\nthe application of comprehensive scientific and professional knowledge to the planning, conduct, evaluation and management of fundamental research, knowledge enhancement, technology development and innovation relevant to the natural sciences as defined by the Research Group;\n\nAlso excluded are positions that do not require the application of comprehensive scientific and professional knowledge relevant to meteorology.\n\nAlso excluded are positions that are included in the Patent Examination Sub-group.\n\nThis factor measures the know-how requirements acquired through formal education, additional study, in-house courses, on-the-job training, and the application of this knowledge to a breadth of practical applications having the diversity and variety.\n\nIs a measurement of the expertise in the theories, principles and practice, of meteorology, and knowledge of other scientific disciplines and their inter-relationships with meteorology required for the position.
